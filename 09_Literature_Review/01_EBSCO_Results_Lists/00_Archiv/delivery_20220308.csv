However, concerns about technical complexity and the benefits of deployment have blunted its adoption. We examine factors that influence managerial intention to adopt blockchain technology. We extend the fit-viability model (FVM) and develop a value-based technology adoption model through an empirical study of 242 managers mostly in medical and financial industries. Managers in such organizations are likely to consider fit and viability in adopting blockchain technology to store and protect data. Drawing upon Fit-Viability and Task-Technology Fit models, and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), we test a model with Partial Least Squares (PLS) to assess managers' intention to adopt blockchain technology. Our findings indicate that functional and symbolic benefits have positive impact on managers' assessment of task-technology fit. Furthermore, viability is an important criterion in adopting blockchain technology.

It’s not that those things aren’t important. But they matter only as means to the ends that people seek. Too many organizations lose sight of this truth. Even when they do promote what they sell in relation to consumers’ aspirations, they rarely design solutions that allow people to realize them. Instead, individuals must cobble together what they think they need to achieve their goals—for example, a trainer, a particular diet, and a support network to lose weight. Enterprises should recognize the economic opportunity offered by a transformation business, in which consumers come to them with a desire to improve some fundamental aspect of their lives. Even though we’re all filled with hopes, aims, and ambitions, significant change is incredibly hard to accomplish on our own. This article offers an approach to designing a transformation business.

Businesses have been combating corruption in fragmented ways, sometimes by creating anti-corruption policies applicable to certain stakeholders and, at other times, by harnessing digital technologies. Recently, the power of blockchain, with its capacity to provide full transactional disclosure and thereby reduce uncertainty, insecurity, and ambiguity in transactions, has been touted as being a game changer in the fight against corruption. Based on a study of the global shipping industry, we find that blockchain mitigates both process and document-related corruption. Based on these findings, we develop an understanding of how corruption may be combated using both social and digital/informational resources, including blockchain technology. Our model, drawing on past work on corruption, shows the complex interplay between identity, institutional actors, technical and other resources, and practices, and we develop conditions that could be effective in fighting corruption by using technologies such as blockchain.

In this paper, we discuss the strategic and economic value of this technology by applying it to the value-added tax (VAT) reporting system, focusing on blockchain's characteristic traceability. By effectively increasing financial transparency, the application of blockchain to the VAT system can prevent VAT-related fraud (e.g., underreported VAT) that can arise due to the information asymmetry that exists at different stages of the supply chain. We develop a game theoretical model that involves a retailer and two vendors in order to study the players' strategic decisions regarding blockchain adoption and to examine the effects on social welfare. We also show how the decision to adopt blockchain depends on considerations such as adoption costs, the vendors' VAT reporting behavior, the retailer's profit margins, and inter-vendor competition. Furthermore, we find that under certain conditions, policymakers can increase social welfare by providing subsidies to encourage blockchain adoption.88 [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Journal of Management Information Systems is the property of Taylor & Francis Ltd and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

Given this unique nature, the century-old challenge in the insurance industry is to effectively reduce transaction costs among the stakeholders while maintaining business privacy and trust. Although blockchain is a promising technology to mitigate this challenge, two technical issues, namely (1) inefficiency in data auditing and (2) difficulty in verifying encrypted data, are of strategic importance when applying blockchain to the insurance industry. To address these technical challenges, we propose an innovative blockchain-based technical model, InsurModel, in the context of newly initiated long-term care insurance in China. Specifically, we utilize cryptographical methods including ""zero-knowledge-proof"" to 1) represent business interdependence and 2) verify confidential business information without disclosure of specifics. We demonstrate the scalability and applicability of InsurModel and explore its strategic implications in constraining adverse behaviors of the stakeholders.

Instead, mining pools as a financial innovation escalate miners' arms race and significantly increase the energy consumption of proof-of-work-based blockchains.

For example, Home Depot, JPMorgan Chase, Starbucks, and Nike have publicly announced that personalized and seamless omnichannel experiences are at the core of their corporate strategy. We are now at the point where competitive advantage will be based on the ability to capture, analyze, and utilize personalized customer data at scale and on how a company uses AI to understand, shape, customize, and optimize the customer journey. The obvious winners have been large tech companies, which have embedded these capabilities in their business models. But challenger brands, such as sweetgreen in restaurants and Stitch Fix in apparel, have designed transformative first-party, data-driven experiences as well. The authors explore how cutting-edge companies use what they call intelligent experience engines to assemble high-quality customer experiences. Although building one can be time-consuming, expensive, and technologically complex, the result allows companies to deliver personalization at a scale that could only have been imagined a decade ago.

Grounded in an in-depth longitudinal multiple-case study, our analysis reveals three practices that help explain how founders' thinking patterns and behaviors shape business model innovation in their ventures: industry-spanning search, complex system thinking style, and powerful centralized decision making. Three corresponding yet opposing founder practices are present in cases with low business model innovation. When interpreted through the lens of imprinting theory, our findings reveal how founders achieve novelty imprinting, which we conceive as imprinting processes that result in novel imprints. Our emergent theoretical framework affirms the possibility of novelty imprinting, and thus explains a puzzle regarding the coexistence of imprint stability and novel structure. It also delineates the nature of cognitive imprinting and explains how cognitive imprints reinforce structural imprints in the context of business model innovation, thereby expanding the scope of imprinting and business model research.

The industry overall, and many fintech start-ups are looking for new pathways to successful business models, the creation of enhanced customer experience, and approaches that result in services transformation. Industry and academic observers believe this to be more of a revolution than a set of less influential changes, with financial services as a whole due for major improvements in efficiency, customer centricity, and informedness. The long-standing dominance of leading firms that are not able to figure out how to effectively hook up with the “Fintech Revolution” is at stake. We present a new fintech innovation mapping approach that enables the assessment of the extent to which there are changes and transformations in four areas of financial services. We discuss: operations management in financial services and the changes occurring; technology innovations that have begun to leverage the execution and stakeholder value associated with payments, cryptocurrencies, blockchain, and cross-border payments; multiple innovations that have affected lending and deposit services, peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, and social media use; issues with respect to investments, financial markets, trading, risk management, robo-advisory and services influenced by blockchain and fintech innovations.

A lot of young ventures, on the other hand, raise vast sums of money and attract tens of millions of customers, only to collapse when they can’t figure out how to fend off imitators. In these situations and many others, the underlying cause is often a failure to take a holistic approach to strategy. Strategy today demands more than classic competitive positioning. It requires making carefully coordinated choices about the opportunities to pursue; the business model with the highest potential to create value; how to capture as much of that value as possible; and the implementation processes that help a firm adapt activities and build capabilities that allow it to realize long-term value. Neglecting any of those imperatives can derail a strategy, but CEOs frequently zero in on just one. Entrepreneurs tend to focus on identifying a golden opportunity and don’t think enough about how to monetize it; leaders of incumbents, on capturing value but not new ways to create it. By tackling all the elements of strategy and integrating them well, however, firms will greatly increase their odds of success. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright 2021 Harvard Business Publishing.

However, telemedicine is a discontinuous digital innovation, and incumbent health care organizations are lagging in its adoption. We combine research on IT innovation adoption and discontinuous innovation to study the relative role of two drivers of discontinuous innovation adoption: digital complementary assets and the regulatory environment. Our findings from 1,753 acute care hospitals across 30 European countries suggest that digital complementary assets have a stronger effect on telemedicine innovation adoption than the regulatory framework. In addition, we observe application- and business model-specific differences. Overall, our findings add the role of organizational versus regulatory drivers of discontinuous innovation adoption to information systems research, emphasize the importance of digital complementary assets for the adoption of discontinuous innovation by incumbent organizations, and provide new insights into how the diffusion of telemedicine innovation can be accelerated.

Yet, an understanding of the technology's financial value remains elusive. Based on 175 firm announcements between 2015 and 2019, we conduct an international event study to estimate the impact of blockchain initiatives on the market value of the firm. We empirically demonstrate that blockchain announcements are associated with a significant average abnormal return of 0.30% on the announcement day, and that there are indications of positive long‐term effects on shareholder value. We further demonstrate how blockchain use case, project, and firm characteristics affect the stock market reaction. Specifically, we find that the stock market reaction to blockchain announcements is less positive when blockchain is used to trace physical objects or to share sensitive data, providing empirical evidence for the risk associated with current challenges in the design of blockchain use cases. Our results also suggest that the involvement of an external information technology service provider in a blockchain project attenuates the positive stock market reaction. Interestingly, more innovative firms do not experience a stronger stock market reaction to blockchain announcements. Leveraging the international scope of our sample, we further shed light on how the firm's competitive (i.e., industry factors) and macro environment (i.e., country factors) affect the stock market reaction. Our findings indicate that the industry's R&D intensity and the country's data restriction level play a crucial role in driving the value attributed to blockchain initiatives.

This research pays special attention to the governance of blockchain systems and illustrates decision problems in 14 blockchain systems from four application domains. Based on academic literature, semi-structured interviews with representatives from those organizations, and content analysis of grey literature, common problems in blockchain governance have been singled out and contextualized. Studying their enactment revealed their relevance to major organizational theories in what we labelled “Patrolling the borders,” “External Legitimation,” “Reduction of Discretionality,” and “Temporal Management.” The identification of these problems enriches the scarce body of knowledge on the governance of blockchain systems, resulting in a better understanding of how blockchain governance links to existing concepts and how it is enacted in practice.

By studying five ventures in a nascent financial-technology market, we develop a novel theoretical framework for understanding how entrepreneurs effectively design business models: parallel play. Similar to parallel play by preschoolers, entrepreneurs engaged in parallel play interweave action, cognition, and timing to accelerate learning about a novel world. Specifically, they (1) borrow from peers and focus on established substitutes for their services or products, (2) test assumptions, then commit to a broad business-model template, and (3) pause before elaborating the activity system. The insights from our framework contribute to research on optimal distinctiveness and to the learning and evolutionary-adjustment literatures. More broadly, we blend organization theory with a fresh theoretical lens—business-model processes—to highlight how organizations actually work and create value.

Unfortunately, their long-term adoption in the business world is imperiled by a lack of stability that manifests as dramatic swings in transaction fees and severe participant dissatisfaction. To date, there has been little academic effort to study how system participants react to volatility in fee movements. Our study addresses this research gap by conceptualizing the Bitcoin platform as a data space market and studying how market equilibrium forms between users who demand data space while trying to avoid transaction delays, and miners who supply data space while trying to maximize fee revenues. Our empirical analysis based on past bitcoin transactions reveals the existence of a relatively flat downward-sloping demand curve and a much steeper upward-sloping supply curve. Regarding users, the inelastic nature of demand signals the utility of Bitcoin as a niche platform for transactions that are otherwise difficult to conduct. This result challenges the belief that users may easily abandon Bitcoin technology given rising transaction costs. We also find that the use of bitcoins as a trading asset is associated with higher levels of tolerance to fees. Regarding miners, the comparatively elastic nature of supply indicates that higher fees stimulate mining by a larger magnitude than suppressing demand. This finding implies that, ceteris paribus, the Bitcoin system turns to self-regulate transaction fees in an efficient manner. Our work has implications for the management of congestion in blockchain-based systems and more broadly for the stability of cryptocurrency markets.

Attending to personal preferences in such contexts, increasingly vital for customer acceptance, may run counter to efficiency, thus constraining value creation and rendering efficiency-personalization trade-offs a key managerial challenge. For the case of autonomous vehicles (AVs), we formalize this trade-off and design a machine-learning approach to handle it by drawing on a unique dataset comprising 35,000 drives by 1,850 users. We consider the real-time dynamics and user interactions that affect the decisions of AVs and develop a model extension that allows for leveraging the properties of sharing business models to make better-informed decisions. Our study contributes to information systems (IS) AV research by providing an artifact that targets both efficiency and personalization of AV operations as well as the dynamic balance between the two. With the focus on everyday life contexts, our study points to the value of incorporating trade-offs between competing goals as well as human-centered perspectives in information systems designs for research on BDA value creation.

To examine this, we draw on the upper‐echelons literature and on research on business models as activity systems to theorize that cognitive and ideological diversity in TMTs will affect teams' attention to business model innovation (BMI) and companies' BMI intensity. Analysis of longitudinal data from firms in the US printing and publishing industry provides support for the theory that, over time, TMT cognitive and ideological diversity have a positive influence on BMI. Whereas cognitive diversity expands TMT's BMI attention‐scope, both cognitive and ideological diversity increase BMI intensity. However, too much ideological diversity has a negative effect. We furthermore find that TMT longevity moderates the effects of TMT diversity positively, suggesting that the benefit of diversity grows as team members work together longer as a team. We discuss the study's contributions to the literature on diversity, BMI, and the upper echelons.

However, little is known about what factors influence consumer perceptions of purchases from firms using these models. The authors propose that features inherent to the P2P model lead consumers to perceive high provider–firm independence, where providers are viewed as relatively independent from the platform on which they offer goods/services. Across a series of studies, the authors show that when P2P brands use provider-focused (vs. platform-focused) marketing communications, consumers perceive a purchase as helping an individual provider to a greater extent, which increases consumers' willingness to pay and their likelihood of both making a purchase and downloading the brand's app. This is because provider-focused marketing communications in this context lead consumers to think about their purchase from the provider's perspective, thus adopting an ""empathy lens."" The authors further show that this effect does not extend to other business models. This work thus identifies provider- (vs. platform-) focused marketing communications as a way for marketing managers of P2P brands to drive important purchase-related outcomes.

On the Bitcoin Blockchain, an owning entity's real-world identity is hidden behind a pseudonym, a so-called address. Therefore, Bitcoin is widely assumed to provide a high degree of anonymity, which is a driver for its frequent use for illicit activities. This paper presents a novel approach for de-anonymizing the Bitcoin Blockchain by using Supervised Machine Learning to predict the type of yet-unidentified entities. We utilized a sample of 957 entities (with ≈385 million transactions), whose identity and type had been revealed, as training set data and built classifiers differentiating among 12 categories. Our main finding is that we can indeed predict the type of a yet-unidentified entity. Using the Gradient Boosting algorithm with default parameters, we achieve a mean cross-validation accuracy of 80.42% and F1-score of ≈79.64%. We show two examples, one where we predict on a set of 22 clusters that are suspected to be related to cybercriminal activities, and another where we classify 153,293 clusters to provide an estimation of the activity on the Bitcoin ecosystem. We discuss the potential applications of our method for organizational regulation and compliance, societal implications, outline study limitations, and propose future research directions.

Understanding the implications of this flexibility is a fundamental problem for an increasing number of firms operating in these markets. In this study, we empirically analyze how consumer usage and payment behaviors interact in an application of rent‐to‐own to the distribution of solar lamps in developing countries. By exploiting the longitudinal variation in the data—and hence accounting for intrinsic differences between customers—the analysis led to three main insights. First, higher usage rates lowered the probability of late payments by customers. Our characterization of this engagement effect enhances existing knowledge of the drivers of payment behavior in these environments. Second, customers often ""bundled"" payments, making advance payments for future product access. We showed that bundling the initial payment led to lower usage rates (bundling effect), suggesting that firms may not benefit from advance payments upfront, and that they should closely track usage patterns from these customers. Finally, we showed that first‐period usage information can improve the accuracy of predictive models of default and that observing usage rates in subsequent periods does not lead to further improvements. Overall, the analysis highlights the importance for firms of jointly tracking and analyzing payment and usage behavior by customers, particularly in initial stages of the adoption process.

They could seek to encourage these markets or compete against them by offering their own rentals. This work shows why the best business model depends on whether consumer usage rates vary or not. Contrary to what might be expected, this paper shows that manufacturers have an incentive to facilitate transactions of P2P rental markets in a large variety of cases. We find that when consumer variation in usage rates is intermediate, the manufacturer is surprisingly best off avoiding offering its own direct rentals option and instead, facilitating a peer-to-peer rental market where consumers can share among themselves. The reason for this is an effect unique to the sharing economy, the equalizing effect. The equalizing effect shows that peer-to-peer rentals uniquely make previously heterogeneous willingness-to-pay among consumers more similar, making it easier for the firm to discriminate between the higher- and lower-value consumers, thus allowing it to extract a higher portion of consumers' surplus. Surprisingly, there are some cases where peer-to-peer rentals benefit the manufacturer, but consumers are hurt overall (though the lower-usage consumers do always benefit from the availability of peer-to-peer rentals). Business models that provide access to assets rather than transfer ownership of goods have become an important industry trend, representing a challenge for incumbent firms. This paper analyzes the interaction of a peer-to-peer (P2P) rental market and a manufacturer of durable goods, and highlights the important role of consumer heterogeneity in usage rates in determining which business model would be preferred by the manufacturer. The introduction of a P2P rental market creates an equalizing effect, which leads to purchases from low-usage consumers. P2P rentals act as a discrimination device, allowing the manufacturer to segment consumers and extract a larger fraction of surplus, which might hurt consumers. The manufacturer is better off with P2P rentals when the heterogeneity in usage rates is intermediate, whereas the consumers are better off with P2P rentals when the heterogeneity is sufficiently high. This paper examines different business models such as the manufacturer with only sales, with rentals in addition to sales (the ""dual"" firm), with its own P2P rentals platform alongside sales (the ""P2P-sponsoring"" firm), and with a mixed structure in which the manufacturer competes against P2P rentals by introducing its own direct rentals (the ""dual-plus-P2P"" firm). Consumer heterogeneity in usage rates plays a fundamental role in business model outcomes. When usage rates and heterogeneity in usage rates are sufficiently large, the manufacturer is better off offering sales and facilitating a P2P rental market. In contrast, if heterogeneity in usage rates is too low, the manufacturer prefers to offer only sales. If heterogeneity is too high but usage rates are below a threshold, the manufacturer prefers to operate as a dual firm that offers both sales and rentals directly to consumers. If P2P rentals are unavoidable, introducing its own rentals to compete against P2P rentals might not be the best strategy for the manufacturer under certain conditions. Overall, contrary to what could be expected, the manufacturer has an incentive to facilitate P2P rentals in a large variety of cases.

Blockchain has the capacity to chronologically capture and store transactional data in a standardized and tamperproof format that is transparent to all stakeholders involved in the transaction. This, in turn, has prompted companies to rethink preexisting business practices, thereby yielding a myriad of fascinating business models anchored in blockchain technology. In this study, we advance contemporary knowledge of business applications of blockchain by drawing on the theoretical lens of the digital business model and value configuration to decipher how pioneers in this space are leveraging blockchain to create and capture value. Through a comparative, multiple case study approach, we analyzed five companies in mainland China that have rolled out blockchain initiatives. From our case analyses, we derived a typology of five blockchain-inspired business models, each of which embodies a distinctive logic for market differentiation. For each business model, we offer insights into its value creation logic, its value capturing mechanism, and the challenges that could threaten its longer-term viability.

The global energy transition presents a challenge for almost all industries, but some face specific difficulties particularly important from an IB perspective. We study a set of European firms that used to operate in a highly regulated context with (partial) state ownership, until government-directed market liberalization started to allow further competition and internationalization. Existing firms were prompted to adapt their business models to these changes, with new ventures entering the market to reap opportunities with novel energy-related technologies and business models. Linking insights from strategic management to the IB literature, we conceptualize business model-related specific advantages (BMSAs), and explore the role of BMSAs in the internationalization of the firms in our sample. We also uncover barriers to BMSA recombination in (potential) host countries, consider BMSA location-boundedness, and discuss implications for firms' international expansion by presenting a new framework. Consequences for the energy transition and the actors already involved and (in)directly confronted with it are explicated, while outlining promising areas for further research, building on the insights and limitations of our study.

La transición energética global presenta un reto para casi todas las industrias, pero algunas enfrentan dificultades específicas particularmente importantes desde una perspectiva de negocios internacionales. Estudiamos un conjunto de empresas europeas que solían operar en un contexto altamente regulado con propiedad estatal (parcial), hasta que la liberalización de mercado dirigida por el gobierno comenzó a permitir una mayor competencia e internacionalización. Las empresas existentes fueron incitadas a adaptar sus modelos de negocio a estos retos, con nuevas empresas que ingresaron al mercado para aprovechar oportunidades con las tecnologías novedosas relacionadas con la energía y modelos de negocios. Vinculando los aportes de la gestión estratégica a la literatura de negocios internacionales, conceptualizamos las ventajas específicas relacionadas con los modelos de negocios, y exploramos el papel de las ventajas específicas relacionadas con los modelos de negocios en la internacionalización de empresas de nuestra muestra. También encontramos barreras para la recombinación de ventajas específicas relacionadas con los modelos de negocios en países anfitriones (potenciales), consideramos los limites de ubicación de las ventajas específicas relacionadas con los modelos de negocios, y discutimos las implicaciones para la expansión internacional de las empresas al presentar un nuevo marco. Las consecuencias para la transición energética y los actores ya involucrados e (in) directamente confrontados con esta son explicados, mientras que se describen áreas prometedoras para la investigación futura, basándonos en los aportes y limitaciones de nuestro estudio.

La transition énergétique mondiale présente un défi pour presque toutes les industries, mais certaines sont confrontées à des difficultés spécifiques particulièrement importantes du point de vue de l'IB. Nous étudions un ensemble d'entreprises européennes qui opéraient dans un contexte hautement réglementé avec une participation (partielle) de l'État, jusqu'à ce que la libéralisation du marché dirigée par le gouvernement commence à permettre davantage de concurrence et d'internationalisation. Les entreprises existantes ont dû adapter leurs BM à ces changements, avec de nouvelles entreprises entrant sur le marché pour saisir des opportunités avec de nouvelles technologies et BM liés à l'énergie. En reliant les connaissances du management stratégique à la littérature de l'IB, nous conceptualisons les avantages spécifiques liés aux BM (ASBM) et explorons le rôle des ASBM dans l'internationalisation des entreprises de notre échantillon. Nous découvrons également les barrières à la recombinaison des ASBM dans les pays hôtes (potentiels), considérons la délimitation de la localisation des ASBM et discutons des implications pour l'expansion internationale des entreprises en présentant un nouveau cadre. En s'appuyant sur les perspectives et les limites de notre étude, les conséquences pour la transition énergétique et les acteurs déjà impliqués et (in)directement confrontés à celle-ci sont expliquées, tout en soulignant des domaines prometteurs pour des recherches ultérieures.

A transição energética global apresenta um desafio para quase todas as indústrias, mas algumas enfrentam dificuldades específicas particularmente importantes a partir de uma perspectiva de IB. Nós estudamos um conjunto de empresas europeias que costumavam operar em um contexto altamente regulado com propriedade (parcialmente) estatal, até que a liberalização de mercado dirigida pelo governo começou a permitir maior concorrência e internacionalização. Empresas existentes foram impelidas a adaptar seus BMs a essas mudanças, com novos empreendimentos entrando no mercado para colher oportunidades com novas tecnologias e BMs relacionados à energia. Ligando insights de gestão estratégica com a literatura de IB, conceitualizamos vantagens específicas relacionadas a BM (BMSAs) e exploramos o papel de BMSAs na internacionalização das empresas em nossa amostra. Também revelamos barreiras para recombinação de BMSA em (potenciais) países anfitriões, consideramos a limitação de localização de BMSA e discutimos as implicações para a expansão internacional de empresas pela apresentando um novo modelo. Consequências para a transição energética e os atores já envolvidos e (in) diretamente confrontados com ela são explicadas, ao mesmo tempo em delineamos áreas promissoras para pesquisas futuras, com base nos insights e limitações de nosso estudo.

Over three decades, Alessi developed three different strategies to combine normative elements of the two logics, using each strategy to envision and pursue different market opportunities. By combining the logics of industrial manufacturing and cultural production, Alessi was able to envision new possibilities for value creation and to enact them through innovation in product design. The three strategies triggered a common set of mechanisms through which the purposeful combining of logics enabled the pursuit of opportunity, while each strategy structured the process differently. We develop a theoretical model linking the development of recombinant strategies to the dynamic restructuring of organizational agency and the related capacity to create and pursue new market opportunities. Our findings and theoretical insights advance understanding of the processes through which organizations challenge taken-for-granted beliefs and practices to create new market opportunities, use logics as resources to enable embedded agency, and design hybrid organizational arrangements.

Every time we use their services, the same thing happens: Rather than relying on processes run by employees, the value we get is delivered by algorithms. Software is at the core of the enterprise, and humans are moved off to the side. This model frees firms from traditional operating constraints and enables them to compete in unprecedented ways. AI-driven processes can be scaled up very rapidly, allow for greater scope because they can be connected to many kinds of businesses, and offer very powerful opportunities for learning and improvement. And while the value of scale eventually begins to level off in traditional models, in AI-based ones, it never stops climbing. All of that allows AI-driven firms to quickly overtake traditional ones. As AI models blur the lines between industries, strategies are relying less on specialized expertise and differentiation based on cost, quality, and branding, and more on business network position, unique data, and the deployment of sophisticated analytics.

This paper investigates a monopolistic platform's optimal protection level and pricing strategy under an agency business model (content agency model or advertising agency model). We find that the platform's protection strategy hinges on the relative magnitude of the two opposing effects of protection. When the negative effect dominates, the minimal protection is optimal. However, as the positive effect becomes more salient, the platform has an incentive to increase the protection level. We also find that although the demand of non-pure platform users always increases as the level of content substitutability rises under the minimal and maximal protection regions, it is not necessarily the case under the medium protection region. The study advances our understanding of the content protection against piracy from a platform's perspective. Our findings also provide insights into business model decision when platform protection is endogenously determined.

Altogether, the papers delineate a new organizational framework for doing business in emerging markets and for optimizing gains from emerging market innovations. This Special Issue defines and clearly differentiates emerging market innovations (EMIs) from developed market innovations (DMIs) and provides a generalizable framework. The proposed framework corresponds to the process whereby developed market firms do business in emerging markets, capitalize on the innovative potential therein, reap the benefits and drawbacks of reverse innovations back to developed markets, and, finally, continually refine and optimize their innovation strategies. This study offers crucial managerial guidance through discussion on marketing to the Bottom-of-Pyramid (BoP), the importance of Grassroots Innovation (GRI), the necessity of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) strategies, and the role of employees in open innovation. Lastly, this Special Issue posits conceptual and methodological limitations and future research direction to capture the emerging market phenomena entirely.

To be sure, in some cases such a paradigm shift is involved. But the authors’ research and work suggest that wholesale disruption is often quite unnecessary. Some companies have successfully responded to the digital challenge by making major changes to their manufacturing processes, distribution channels, or business models, but many others have fared equally well using a more incremental approach that leaves the core value proposition and supply chain essentially unchanged.

While most business model frameworks envision value creation as a uni-directional flow between the focal business and its customers, this article presents a broader view based on a stringent application of stakeholder theory. It provides a stakeholder value creation framework derived from key characteristics of stakeholder theory. This article highlights mutual stakeholder relationships in which stakeholders are both recipients and (co-) creators of value in joint value creation processes. Key findings include that the concept and analysis of value creation through business models need to be expanded with regard to (i) different types of value created with and for different stakeholders and (ii) the resulting value portfolio, i.e., the different kinds of value exchanged between the company and its stakeholders. This paper details the application of the stakeholder value creation framework and its theoretical propositions for the case of business models for sustainability. The framework aims to support theoretical and empirical analyses of value creation as well as the management and transformation of business models in line with corporate sustainability ambitions and stakeholder expectations. Overall, this paper proposes a shift in perspective from business models as devices of sheer value creation to business models as devices that organize and facilitate stakeholder relationships and corresponding value exchanges.

Meanwhile, many well-resourced incumbents struggle to develop extended digital relationships with customers. That’s partly because it’s hard for companies to change their established business models. But the authors point out another inhibitor—there are repercussions up and down the value chain. The authors explain that successful upstarts do not just capture and use new data effectively; they also break from traditional reliance on outside partners for sourcing inputs and distributing and servicing products. They keep more functions in-house—a necessary part of launching an innovation. But if incumbents do likewise in their own efforts to take advantage of digital technology, they risk upsetting longtime relationships with suppliers, distributors, and other collaborators. To navigate this new world, the authors advise managers in traditional companies to think about the macro trends that will shape their industry in the future, agree on a digital strategy to address customers’ needs in the long term, and develop better metrics to monitor progress. Incumbents must also create new business opportunities for partners so that everyone benefits from the new ecosystem.

The blockchain is a data store designed to promote data privacy, as well as transaction integrity. Enterprises in several industries, especially banking, have investigated the implementation of blockchain-based databases to replace centralised databases as one mechanism for protecting customers’ data by separating transactional data from personally identifiable information. Despite the blockchain’s privacy protections, consumers remain largely unaware of these benefits. Building on the Health Belief Model (HBM), we include privacy concerns and inertia as critical factors that influence consumers’ perceptions of blockchain-based databases’ benefits. Using a sample of 304 respondents, we test a theoretical model incorporating these factors. Our study results indicate threat severity, threat susceptibility, awareness, and inertia significantly influence the perceived benefits of blockchain, which has a significant positive influence on consumers’ intention to switch to blockchain-based applications. Although consumers’ comfort with the status quo of traditional banking mechanisms is a significant barrier to the realisation of blockchain banking applications benefits, additional awareness of consumer privacy protections can persuade customers to use the blockchain-based applications, especially if they exhibit heightened privacy concerns.

The hardware product in the platform business model introduces three important issues that are not yet well understood in the literature of platform pricing: potentially downward‐trending production cost, product quality improvements, and consumers' strategic behaviors. Using analytical modeling, our study explicitly factors in these issues in analyzing a monopoly platform owner's two‐sided pricing problem. The platform sequentially introduces and prices quality‐improving hardware products, for which the costliness of quality may decrease. Strategic buyers make purchasing and upgrading decisions, which dynamically determine the buyer‐side network size. Meanwhile, the seller‐side network size is determined endogenously. We find that, an increase in the likelihood or magnitude of the future costliness reduction raises the initial buyer‐side price of the low‐quality product and lowers the seller‐side fee. This strategy, in turn, creates an indirect intertemporal effect that allows the platform to also raise the buyer‐side price(s) of the product(s) sold later. These findings contrast with conventional wisdom and provide an economic explanation for premium introductory pricing of many platform products. Moreover, we find that strengthening the network effect can result in more pronounced increases in the buyer‐side prices.

Advances in the technology’s capabilities and expansion of the available materials and the supplier ecosystem have made it possible to produce a much broader range of affordable things—from the soles of running shoes to turbine blades—and, in many cases, in much higher volumes. As a result, 3-D printing is moving from a limited role (such as prototyping and making conventional machine tools) to a central place in manufacturing for a growing number of industries. Strategically, that means additive is becoming a full-fledged competitive weapon: It can be used to hold on to market leadership, to dethrone the dominant player, and to diversify by exploiting a printer’s capability to make products for different industries. Consequently, leaders need to understand additive’s capability and potential and the choices open to them in the near future. This article presents them with a playbook and explores six possible business models that have emerged. INSETS: ADVANCES THAT ARE TAKING 3-D PRINTING MAINSTREAM.;THE TEMPTATION OF INDUSTRY 4.0..

Entrepreneurial endeavours to this end are diverse. Indeed, the propensity toward complexity is considerable, bridging a range of financial services, markets, innovations, industry participants, infrastructures, and technologies. This study aims to improve comprehension of the global fintech landscape. It is based on the analysis of start-ups that participated in SWIFT's Innotribe competition. We used cluster analysis to group 402 fintech start-up firms, and then selected representative cases to create a foundational understanding of the structure of the fintech landscape. The main findings of this work are: (1) the development of fintech clusters to classify core services, business infrastructures, and underlying component technologies, which characterize fintech; (2) an analysis of how fintechs synthesize different technologies to restructure flows of financial information through competitive and cooperative mechanisms of disinter-mediation, extension of access, financialization, hybridization, and personalization; (3) an analysis of related strategies for value creation connected with the competitive and cooperative mechanisms that were identified. Collectively, our results offer new insights into the diversity and range of emergent innovations and technologies that Q2 are transforming the financial services industry worldwide.

It was mostly done by middle-aged people sitting at PCs who scrolled through profiles and waited for responses. If they found and connected with someone, they’d often claim they “met through friends” to avoid the stigma that online dating carried. Since then, significant industrywide shifts in technology and business models have completely changed how people use Match products. Now online dating is done via apps on mobile phones; it has moved from monthly subscriptions to a “freemium” pricing model; and it has been embraced by people in their twenties, who are the dominant users of Tinder and similar brands. Mandy Ginsberg describes what it’s like to lead in an industry with such fast innovation cycles and discusses incorporating full-motion video into dating apps—part of an effort to predict whether sparks ignited online will persist as chemistry in real life.

Although the adoption of digital technologies by firms has been studied extensively from a technical point of view, previous research lacks insight into the managerial aspects of digital transformation, which, given the transformation's interdisciplinarity, might have substantial implications for information systems research. In particular, it is unclear how small and medium-sized family-controlled firms (known as family-owned Mittelstand firms) with resource constraints handle digital transformation. This paper addresses this gap by drawing on rich data from 127 semi-structured interviews in a multiple case study of 15 family-owned Mittelstand firms from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. All of these firms are active in the manufacturing industry but vary in terms of their digital transformation progress. Based on within-case and cross-case pattern analysis, we propose that the digital transformation of Mittelstand firms is a process consisting of three stages, namely, process digitalisation, product and service digitalisation, and business model digitalisation, and we reveal triggers for each stage and the dynamic capabilities needed throughout this process. Moreover, we identify three combinations of enablers and barriers that support or hinder the development of dynamic capabilities and thus accelerate or impede the advancement of the digital transformation process.

This special issue addresses the need for innovative research that offers a fresh look at the opportunities and challenges of blockchain. This editorial integrates and goes beyond the papers included in this special issue by providing a framework for blockchain research in IS that emphasizes two important issues. First, we direct the attention of IS research toward the blockchain protocol level, which is characterized by recursive interactions between human agents and the blockchain protocol. Second, we highlight the need for IS research to consider how the protocol level constrains and affords blockchain applications, and how these constraints and other concerns at the application level lead to changes at the protocol level. Rooted in a socio-material view of IS, we offer a multi-paradigmatic IS research agenda that underscores the need for behavioral (individual, group, and organizational), design science, and IS economics research on blockchain. Our research agenda emphasizes issues of blockchain governance, human and material agency, blockchain affordances and constraints, as well as the consequences of its use.

But knowing when to undertake strategic transformation—when to change a company’s core products or business model because of impending industry disruption—may be the hardest decision a leader faces. Five interrelated “fault lines” can indicate that the ground beneath a company is unstable and that it’s time for radical change. The authors’ fault line framework addresses basic issues: whether the business serves the right customers, uses the right performance metrics, is positioned properly in its industry, deploys the correct business model, and has employees and partners who possess the capabilities required for future success. The framework can help executives build a case for change and persuade stakeholders to support the decision. And by identifying gaps between an organization’s current state and where it needs to be to continue to thrive, it can inform the vision of how the company must transform. Diagnostic questions and an in-depth look at the health care company Aetna—an organization in the midst of an ambitious transformation effort, where one of the authors (Mark Bertolini) is CEO—illuminate how to detect the fault lines while there’s still ample time to respond.

The emergence of blockchain platforms offers a unique opportunity to examine alternative structures for platform governance and to develop a theory around the value of centralized, semi-decentralized, and decentralized governance. Drawing on mechanism design theory, we evaluate the tradeoffs between centralization and decentralization and hypothesize semi-decentralization as a higher performing governance structure. Empirical evidence from the blockchain industry shows that decentralization has an inverted U-shaped relationship with platforms' market capitalization, developer attention, and development activity. We further examine factors driving the decentralization of platform governance and find that digital platforms of the infrastructure layer—relative to those of the application layer—have a tendency to become more decentralized. This tendency, nevertheless, can be offset by experienced leaders to achieve semi-decentralization. Overall, this study contributes new insights on the characteristics, antecedents, and consequences of effective platform governance.

Similarly, firms selling software (such as software as a service), and cloud-based services may provide free limited-version products or a free-trial period for the service. In this article, the authors focus on how firms should design such free samples to maximize their revenue. They examine in an analytical setting how quality and other design parameters of the sample affect profit generated by the product or service. They then test the normative implications in the application context of a book publisher that provides free samples for the books it sells online. Using a field experiment, the authors vary the design parameters of the sample and, based on the demand estimates, provide recommendations for the firm on the optimal design of the sample. They find that, rather than being substitutes, free samples of the entire content can be very effective in increasing revenues. Furthermore, they find that higher-quality samples have a greater impact on the sales of popular content. This has important implications for freemium and free-trial business models.

The authors propose an agent-based framework that aggregates social network–level individual interactions to guide the construction of a successful DSS for WOM. The framework presents a set of guidelines and recommendations to (1) involve stakeholders, (2) follow a data-driven iterative modeling approach, (3) increase validity through automated calibration, and (4) understand the DSS behavior. This framework is applied to build a DSS for a freemium app in which premium users discuss the product with their social network and promote its viral adoption. After its validation, the agent-based DSS forecasts the aggregate number of premium sales over time and the most likely users to become premium in the near future. The experiments show how the DSS can help managers by forecasting premium conversions and increasing the number of premiums through targeting and implementing reward policies.

They represent an important but as yet understudied type of complex services that integrates many stakeholders acting in service value networks. These complex services typically comprise a combination of information technology (IT) services and highly person-oriented, non-IT services, and are characterized by long service delivery periods. In such an environment, it is particularly difficult to generate successful and sustainable business models, which are necessary for the widespread provision of telemedicine services. Following a design research approach, we develop and evaluate the CompBizMod framework, a morphological box allowing for: (1) the analysis, description, and classification of telemedicine business models, (2) the identification of white spots for future business opportunities, (3) and the identification of patterns for successful business models. We contribute to the literature by presenting a specific business model framework and identifying three business model patterns in the telemedicine industry. We exhibit how business models for complex services can be decomposed into their constituent elements and present an easy and replicable approach for identifying business model patterns in a given industry.

In addition, artists do not typically receive proceeds after the initial sale. This paper, for the first time, uses archivally sourced primary market records to model returns on art and introduces a novel fractional equity structure for artists. We first model what would happen if the American artists Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg had retained 10% equity in their work when it was first sold. Second, we model a portfolio return using data from the Betty Parsons Gallery and the Green Gallery. To add a portfolio analysis to the performance of ""star"" artists, we model the galleries as a fund invested in all of artworks sold, using auction sales as the realization event. We find that the individual Johns and Rauschenberg works would have vastly outperformed equities markets. The gallery portfolio still substantially outperforms the S&P, even including 20% transaction costs. Beyond the art market, our larger conceptual framework for retained fractional equity has broad implications for compensation of early-stage creative work in any field and for potential applications of blockchain technology.

Ltd.; Intel Corp.; Semiconductor and Related Device Manufacturing","economies of scope; entry; exit; resource redeployment; resource‐based theory","This study explores how firms decide in which businesses to further invest and from which businesses to withdraw resources by examining the detailed product portfolios of firms in the global semiconductor industry. Results show that resource redeployment within incumbent businesses is more prevalent than via new entry or complete exit, since the former is more flexible and easily reversible than the latter. This study further finds that, while underutilized resources may drive resource redeployment, resource shortage by a newly entered or expanding incumbent business may also siphon resources away from other incumbent businesses, leading to their exit or temporary retrenchment. Fabless firms with resource that are more fungible, scalable, and decomposable vis‐a‐vis integrated device manufacturers show a more flexible and gradual pattern of resource redeployment. Managerial summary: In fast‐moving environments, firms should quickly redeploy resources to more promising business areas. We find fabless firms with more fungible, scale free, and decomposable resources engage in more active resource redeployment than integrated device manufacturers with specialized fabs and equipment, like Intel or Samsung. Redeployment among the latter requires a well‐planned, synchronized approach so as to avoid idle resources. As such, in order to take advantage of dynamic resource redeployment, managers should begin by assessing the characteristics of firm resources along these dimensions. Managers may also consider business model transformation to separate their activities by specializing in areas in which they can best utilize their resources and capabilities, like fabless firms and foundries in the semiconductor industry.

"On Ethical Violations in Microfinance Backed Small Businesses: Family and Household Welfare.","Nilakantan, Rahul; Iyengar, Deepak; Datta, Samar K.; Rao, Shashank","Journal of Business Ethics",="01674544",,="Sep2021","172","4","785","18","152013336","10.1007/s10551-020-04499-0","Springer Nature","Article","Microfinance; Small business finance; Mortgage-backed securities; Social impact; Family loans; Trust","Bottom of pyramid; Ethical violations","The microfinance business model focuses largely on lending to the woman in the household, rather than the man. The belief is that women are more trustworthy borrowers than men, and that lending to women may have increased social impact. Yet in several cases, women do not have control over the loan backed business despite being the borrower of record. Such takeover of the business by the man constitutes an ethical violation. We find that high dependency ratios in the family are correlates of such ethical violations. Further, we also find that ethical violations have a significant economic cost, consistent with prior scholarship in the family-business domain. While access to microfinance increases household welfare, this beneficial impact reduces by over 50% in the presence of an ethical violation. Our results suggest that microfinance lenders need to move beyond the traditional role of just being a lender to providing advice on issues like family planning, and money management, and enforcement, thus moving closer to the solidarity economy paradigm of integrating savings and credit into broader canvases of social relationships and social structures.

This research sheds light on this important process by analyzing a major Italian news media publisher reacting to the advent of the internet and the emergence of new business models by entrants into the industry (1995–2017). We specifically examine: (1) the drivers and impeding factors of business model adaptation; (2) how incumbents change strategies to cope with different components of the disruption process; and (3) how a closed business model can be renewed to develop an open, platform‐based business model to seize external opportunities, incur lower costs, and fend off disruptors.

This digital infrastructure has, in turn, accelerated the emergence of new technologies that enable transformations in how we live and work, how companies organize, and the structure of entire industries. As a result, it has become important for all business students to have a strong grounding in IT and digital innovation in order to manage, lead, and transform organizations that are increasingly dependent on digital innovation. Yet, at many schools, students do not get such grounding because the required information systems core class is stuck in the past. We present a vision for a redesigned IS core class that adopts digital innovation as a fundamental and powerful concept (FPC). A good FPC serves as both a foundational concept and an organizing principle for a course. We espouse a particularly broad conceptualization of digital innovation that allows for a variety of teaching styles and topical emphases for the IS core class. This conceptualization includes three types of innovation (i.e., process, product, and business model innovation), and four stages for the overall innovation process (i.e., discovery, development, diffusion, and impact). Based on this conceptualization, we examine the implications of adopting digital innovation as an FPC. We also briefly discuss broader implications relating to (1) the IS curriculum beyond the core class, (2) the research agenda for the IS field, and (3) the identity and legitimacy of IS in business schools.

In this study, we construct an analytical model to examine the role of online word of mouth in this trend of disintermediation. Online word of mouth can reveal product quality for experience goods and raise awareness to accelerate product diffusion. Intuitively, one would expect that with online word of mouth, creators would be more likely to skip publishers and sell directly to consumers. However, our results suggest that online word of mouth may, in fact, encourage more creators to use publishers for high quality work. Our model also makes predictions on the conditions under which online word of mouth benefits publishers and for what types of products and creators it has the most impact.

Many major players in the financial industry have began to invest in this new technology, and stock exchanges have proposed using blockchains as a new method for trading corporate equities and tracking their ownership. This essay evaluates the potential implications of these changes for managers, institutional investors, small shareholders, auditors, and other parties involved in corporate governance. The lower cost, greater liquidity, more accurate record-keeping, and transparency of ownership offered by blockchains may significantly upend the balance of power among these cohorts.

For example, high-priced landing fees are just a cost of business in the airline industry, aren’t they? Ryanair didn’t think so, and it turned Europe’s unused World War II landing strips into very low cost airports. To be a cell phone service provider, you need to invest in towers, networks, billing systems, and more, right? India’s Airtel said no and leased virtually everything it needed from others. In sharply lowering its costs and improving its working capital model, Airtel was able to offer India’s impoverished consumers cell phone service at a dramatically reduced price. How can companies figure out which rules to break in their industries? By focusing on big structural problems endemic to their industries—not just problems they alone face. There are five common types of industry bottlenecks: (1) an outdated purchase or usage experience, (2) a superfluous major expense category, (3) high financial risks for customers, (4) disengaged employees, and (5) detrimental side effects of the product or service. This article lays out strategies used by real companies for busting those bottlenecks. In doing so, companies stand to significantly reduce their costs—or even eliminate entire cost categories—boost demand levels, and sometimes both. INSET: Idea in Brief..

In a November 2014 article, “How Smart, Connected Products Are Transforming Competition,” Harvard Business School professor Michael Porter and PTC president and CEO James Heppelmann looked at how this shift is changing the structure of industries and forcing firms to rethink their strategies. In this companion article, the authors look at the effects inside firms, examining the impact that smart, connected products have on operations and organizational structure. The new capabilities and vast quantities of data that smart, connected products offer are redefining the activities of the core functions of companies—sometimes radically. As software and cloud-based operating systems become integral to products, new product-development principles emerge, manufacturing components and processes change, and IT security becomes the job of every function. Companies need different skills and expertise, which creates new imperatives for HR. In the marketing function, the ability to track a product’s condition and use shifts the focus to maximizing the product’s value to the customer over time. Customer relationships become continuous and open-ended, service becomes more efficient and proactive, and new business models are enabled. The rich data on location and environment that products provide take logistics to a whole new level. Smart, connected products also alter interactions between functions, in ways that hold major implications for organizational structure. Intense, ongoing coordination becomes necessary across multiple functions, including design, operations, sales, service, and IT. Functional roles overlap and blur. Entirely new functions—unified data organizations, dev-ops, and customer success management—begin to emerge. What is under way is the most substantial change in the manufacturing firm since the Second Industrial Revolution, and the effects are spreading to other industries, like services, as well.

This change has included waves of technological disruption that have been exploited by entrepreneurial actors who seize the associated new opportunities. Research on related phenomena is spread across different disciplines. Recently, there have been calls for further research on the marriage of information systems (IS) and entrepreneurship. We review 292 articles in the IS, entrepreneurship, and general and strategic management literature to create an overview of the IT‐associated entrepreneurship research landscape. On the basis of that review, we elaborate on the different roles that IT can assume to support entrepreneurial operations and value creation in these settings. Our findings suggest that IT plays four major roles in entrepreneurial operations: as a facilitator, making the operations of start‐ups easier; as a mediator for new ventures' operations; as an outcome of entrepreneurial operations; and as a ubiquity, becoming the business model itself. Leveraging these roles of IT, we develop a set of definitions to clear up definition uncertainties surrounding IT‐associated new ventures such as digital start‐ups and digital business models. We also outline a research agenda for IT‐associated entrepreneurship research based on identified roles, types, and gaps.

This special issue explores the roles of institutions and government policies in promoting or impeding innovative entrepreneurship. In this introductory editorial, we review theory and evidence on entrepreneurship at the macro‐institutional and micro‐policy levels, highlighting costs and benefits of alternative institutional environments and targeted policy interventions, as well as interactions within and across levels. We summarize the six papers in the special issue, discuss their contributions to the literature, and suggest how future work can build upon these and other papers to advance our understanding of the conditions and mechanisms underlying successful entrepreneurial innovation. Managerial Summary: Innovation and entrepreneurship bring new products and services to market, help firms and industries to grow, and generate improvements in social and economic life. The papers in this special issue explore the background conditions—laws, political processes, regulations, tax policy, subsidies, training programs, and more—that make entrepreneurship and innovation successful. Both ""macro"" and ""micro"" policies can stimulate successful entrepreneurial and innovative outcomes, but can also become politicized, be ineffective, and generate unintended consequences. The papers offer lessons to researchers, policymakers, and practitioners about making entrepreneurship and innovation more successful.

Typically, clients submit project requests stochastically to a platform which possesses a pool of registered designers. For each submitted project, designers decide whether to participate and attempt to submit a design, and the client either chooses a winner among all submissions, or rejects them all, based on subjective criteria. In general, platforms cannot control individual designers directly because of the nature of the freelance market, incurring possible mismatches between designers and arriving projects. To tackle the problem, we present a dynamic control policy applied to the maximum number of participants for each arrived project. Our study reveals that the optimal policy follows an inverted‐U‐shaped function of the project value, highlighting the importance of applying a stronger restriction on the number of participants for some sufficiently high‐valued projects. In addition, the optimal policy we have developed allows the platform to gain higher rewards judiciously even when the market is more volatile. Furthermore, extensive numerical studies have been conducted to glean managerial insights. Specifically, the optimal policy becomes more beneficial even when more designers are available, which is counter‐intuitive to the common‐sense notion that control should be more valuable when designers are scarcer; and the optimal policy is further shown to be robust when the objective is changed from maximizing the total reward to maximizing the total number of successful projects.

Yet, to date, the scholarly literature on digital platforms has largely concentrated on business while their developmental implications remain understudied. In part, this is because digital platforms are a challenging research object due to their lack of conceptual definition, their spread across different regions and industries, and their intertwined nature with institutions, actors and digital technologies. The purpose of this article is to contribute to the ongoing debate in information systems and ICT4D research to understand what digital platforms mean for development. To do so, we first define what digital platforms are and differentiate between transaction and innovation platforms, and explain their key characteristics in terms of purpose, research foundations, material properties and business models. We add the socio‐technical context digital platforms operate and the linkages to developmental outcomes. We then conduct an extensive review to explore what current areas, developmental goals, tensions and issues emerge in the literature on platforms and development and identify relevant gaps in our knowledge. We later elaborate on six research questions to advance the studies on digital platforms for development: on indigenous innovation, digital platforms and institutions, on exacerbation of inequalities, on alternative forms of value, on the dark side of platforms and on the applicability of the platform typology for development.

Innovative business models—for example, fast fashion (e.g., Zara), e-tailing (e.g., Amazon), and ride-sharing (e.g., Uber)—are capable of offering new products and services that generate considerable consumer utility and transform industries. This paper develops a research framework for understanding business models and how business models have evolved over time. Links are made to the existing literature (primarily in pricing and operations), and simple models are developed to unify and clarify existing research findings. Through this framework, it is possible (i) to identify the few design decisions that explain the success of these diverse firms with otherwise seemingly disparate models, and (ii) to speculate on potential future business-model innovations.

Consequently, business models should have a prominent position in the marketing literature. However, marketing scholars have, so far, paid little attention to the business model concept, perhaps because it lacks an established definition and clear theoretical foundation. This article offers a definition for the business model concept that, using a fractal approach, connects business models to technological and market innovation. Furthermore, the article questions several cornerstone strategic concepts by reconceptualizing business model development from a firm-centric activity that promotes owning key resources and altering sets of decision variables to one that highlights the facilitation of broad institutional change processes.

It doesn’t source or keep stock, and logistics services are carried out by third-party providers. Instead, Alibaba is what you get if you take all the functions associated with retail and coordinate them online into a sprawling, data-driven network of sellers, marketers, service providers, logistics companies, and manufacturers. Indeed, Alibaba does what Amazon, eBay, PayPal, Google, FedEx, all of the wholesalers, and a good portion of manufacturers in the U.S. do, with a healthy helping of financial services for garnish. Alibaba achieves this by leveraging the new technologies of network coordination and data intelligence. It harnesses the efforts of thousands of Chinese businesses to create an ecosystem that is faster, smarter, and more efficient than traditional business infrastructures. This is an emerging business model that Ming Zeng, the chair of Alibaba’s Academic Council, calls smart business. Players in the ecosystem share data and apply machine-learning technology to identify and better fulfill consumer needs. This article provides a framework for transforming a company into a smart business. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright 2018 Harvard Business Publishing. All Rights Reserved.

But as design is used in increasingly complex contexts, a new hurdle has emerged: gaining acceptance of the “designed artifact” into the status quo. In fact, the more innovative a new design is, the more resistance it’s likely to meet. The solution, say the CEO of IDEO and the Rotman School’s former dean, is to also apply design thinking to the introduction of the innovation itself. This process, intervention design, grew organically out of the iterative prototyping that designers did to help understand customers’ reactions to new products. Not only did iterative prototyping create better offerings, but it was a great way to get organizational funding and commitment, because it improved the chances of success and reduced fear of the unknown. Intervention design uses iterative prototyping to get buy-in too, but extends it to interactions with all the principal stakeholders—not just customers. When Intercorp Group devised a revolutionary concept for Peru’s schools, it needed to win acceptance for corporate-run education and for a very different role for teachers. Thanks to intervention design, it now has 29 schools in operation and is rapidly growing. INSETS: Idea in Brief.;The Launch Is Just One Step in the Process..

Targeted online advertising enables websites to increase their advertising revenues by selectively displaying advertisements according to users' browsing behavior, sociodemographics, and interests. Yet targeting also creates negative consumer reactions, and websites confront increasing regulatory pressures to inform consumers about their practices. It is critical for such advertising-supported websites to address those challenges proactively. In one scenario experiment and two field studies, the authors show that a normative reciprocity argument is generally more effective than the current industry practice of using a utilitarian argument related to advertising relevance to increase acceptance of targeted online advertising. However, in some cases, this dominance switches depending on specific website characteristics such as website utility and level of user-generated content. Managers of free websites should remind their users of the free services they enjoy when asking permission to target them online or to use their personal information.

In this study we develop and test a model that explains how online customer behavior is influenced by a firm’s recovery endeavors when privacy breaches occur. Drawing on a service recovery perspective, we integrate the notions of justice perceptions and psychological responses into a theoretical framework. The proposed model was tested against data collected from 1,007 online customers based on a hypothetical scenario. Results show that three types of justice perceptions, distributive, procedural, and interactional justice, jointly affect psychological responses—that is, perceived breach and feelings of violation. In addition, psychological responses were shown to be important in shaping postincident outcomes such as post-word of mouth and post-likelihood of switching. The study gives researchers and practitioners a useful conceptual tool for analyzing the effectiveness of organizational practices in recovering customer relationship after privacy breaches.

We develop a durable goods model to obtain insights for firms considering the use of these strategies. We first analyze the effect of adopting leasing on a firm's product architecture choice. We find that a modular product architecture is more attractive under leasing only if off-lease products depreciate to a greater extent. We next analyze the effect of adopting a modular product architecture on the firm's business model choice. We find that adopting a modular architecture can cause a leasing firm to switch to selling but will not lead a selling firm to switch to leasing. Building on these results, we show that leasing a modular product is preferred by the firm only under limited conditions (i.e., when production costs are low, off-lease products are in relatively better condition, and when there is a large difference between depreciation levels of different modules). Finally, we show that jointly implementing leasing and modularity can also lead to higher environmental impact than only adopting leasing or modularity in isolation.

Both views, however, only address the role of business within larger systems. Little attention has been paid to the everyday material CSR practice of individual managers. We go inside the firm to investigate how the micro-level acts of individual managers can aggregate to drive transformation of the macro-level business logic. We draw on the strategy-as-practice approach to organize our research. The study reveals two orientations towards the integration of personal ethics into the workplace: abdication and activism. These orientations are supported by managerial practice such as reproductive and coping tactics (abdication) and covert and overt tactics (activism); and, three enabling conditions of activist practice: empowerment and psychological safety, moral shock, and morality praxis. While our findings illustrate the tremendous challenges managers face when attempting to influence organizational practices towards their ethical and environmental aspirations, we also show that under specific conditions, individual managers can become fully engaged advocates and drivers of positive change from the inside. In so doing, our individual-level analysis of intrapreneurship provides a more complex picture of the possibilities for positive change than have been previously put forth by mainstream and critical CSR research.

Our discussion centers around one of the most challenging SC&OM problems—food production, distribution, and consumption from dirt to table. We advocate and link our notions of emergent regenerative, organic food value chains (ROFVC) with quadruple‐aim performance (QAP) that connects financial outcomes with ecological, human, and socioeconomic well‐being. To do so, we first overview the systemic problems underlying the conventional food supply chains (CFSC) that render them unsustainable in the long run. In contrast, we introduce salient distinctions between CFSC and the new paradigm of ROFVC that uphold QAP. We believe the ideas generated in this paper can move the food systems' SC&OM design, implementation, and performance measurement from an efficiency‐oriented industrial paradigm of large‐scale, factory farming toward a more encompassing view of eco‐responsible practices. In CFSC, the many hidden costs are cumulative and have broad deleterious consequences; however, in ROFVC, pollution is shunned and ""taxed,"" and sustainability, as a public good, is rewarded by sequestering greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and maintaining biodiversity, living soil, as well as clean air and water. We conclude with research, teaching, and policy agendas. We believe that the underlying principles here cut across sectors by fostering the introduction of regenerative business models that take a system's view in capturing QAP in their value chain strategy and execution.

Writing on the eve of his announcement to step down from the company’s helm, Immelt shares what he learned about leading a giant organization through massive changes. He outlines several lessons: • Be disciplined. This means nesting initiatives within one another and staying away from new ideas that don’t fit. • Soak. Effective leaders don’t react instantly to emerging trends; they read, contemplate, and listen until they believe to their cores that the world is profoundly changing. • Make it existential. Every time Immelt drove a big change, he treated it as if it were life or death. • Be all in. You can’t regard a transformation as an experiment— “You won’t get there if you’re a wuss,” Immelt says. • Be resilient. Transformation requires staying power, and leaders need a thick skin to see it through. • Be willing to pivot. Even as you’re making a major commitment of resources, you need to accept that you’re unlikely to get the strategy perfect out of the gate. • Embrace new kinds of talent. GE now has more senior people from outside the company than at any time in its history and has increased its employment of women, minorities, and workers from outside the U.S. It has transformed its culture and operating rhythm, choosing speed over bureaucracy. Immelt’s legacy at GE will be a complicated one. During his tenure earnings tripled and market share reached record highs, yet the P/E ratio plummeted and the stock price underperformed—no doubt in part because the payoff from some of his bets won’t be clear for a long time to come.

This paper seeks to explore how microfoundations, particularly with respect to human resource management, play a key role in facilitating innovation in business models through the development of key needed capabilities. Four themes are identified with respect to business model innovation (BMI) in the New Normal: BMI as an enabler to create and operate across industries and product‐markets; BMI as a mechanism for firms to better navigate changing institutional landscapes; BMI as giving rise to business model portfolios; and concurrent and cumulative innovations that can lead to BMI. This paper also develops a conceptual framework that presents a synoptic view of the five essential capabilities for BMI, which include analogical reasoning, sensemaking, dynamic capabilities, organisational ambidexterity, and organisational learning. Finally, it is shown how the microfoundations of a bespoke, development‐oriented BMI HR architecture can support the advancement of these capabilities and thus contribute to the strategic HR literature.

The digitization of tasks and processes has become essential to competition. General Electric, for example, was at risk of losing many of its top customers to nontraditional competitors--IBM and SAP on the one hand, big data start-ups on the other--offering data-intensive, analytics-based services that could connect to any industrial device. So GE launched a multibillion-dollar initiative focused on what it calls the industrial internet: adding digital sensors to its machines; connecting them to a common, cloud-based software platform; investing in software development capabilities; building advanced analytics capabilities; and embracing crowd-based product development. With all this, GE is evolving its business model. Now, for example, revenue from its jet engines is tied to reduced downtime and miles flown over the course of a year. After just three years, GE is generating more than $1.5 billion in incremental income with digitally enabled, outcomes based business models. The company expects that number to double in 2014 and again in 2015.

Proliferating digitalization affects the evolution of business models across contexts and challenges firms' established innovation trajectories. Prior work on organizational path dependence suggests that firms experience decreasing option spaces over time and ultimately arrive at lock-in situations that prevent them from reacting to changing environmental conditions. Contemporary business practice, however, challenges these assumptions, as firms—even industrial-age incumbents—appear to be able to escape lock-ins and restore choices. One potential explanation for this could be the flexible nature of digital technologies that are increasingly integrated into business models during digitalization. To explore how and why this process affects organizational path dependence, we conducted a longitudinal multiple case study on connected car business models. We derive four business model archetypes adopted by different companies in the automotive industry and by new entrants, and we describe their evolution over time. We find that the growing integration of digital technologies into business models increases the number of possible pathways and can help to break path-dependent behavior. Based on our findings, we challenge and extend established knowledge on organizational path dependence with regard to key tenets, such as initial conditions and lock-ins, and provide a nuanced perspective on path dependence's resource- and cognition-based foundations.

Although the adoption of digital technologies by firms has been studied extensively from a technical point of view, previous research lacks insight into the managerial aspects of digital transformation, which, given the transformation’s interdisciplinarity, might have substantial implications for information systems research. In particular, it is unclear how small and medium-sized family-controlled firms (known as family-owned Mittelstand firms) with resource constraints handle digital transformation. This paper addresses this gap by drawing on rich data from 127 semi-structured interviews in a multiple case study of 15 family-owned Mittelstand firms from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. All of these firms are active in the manufacturing industry but vary in terms of their digital transformation progress. Based on within-case and cross-case pattern analysis, we propose that the digital transformation of Mittelstand firms is a process consisting of three stages, namely, process digitalisation, product and service digitalisation, and business model digitalisation, and we reveal triggers for each stage and the dynamic capabilities needed throughout this process. Moreover, we identify three combinations of enablers and barriers that support or hinder the development of dynamic capabilities and thus accelerate or impede the advancement of the digital transformation process.

In such technology-intensive supply chains, the technology invented by an upstream firm must be embedded in a subsystem that is then integrated into a full system. The technology providers' prevalent royalty-driven business model has gotten complicated in this multilateral supply chain, prompting formal research attention. Moreover, providers also consider forward integration into manufacturing to monetize their intellectual property. We characterize the appropriateness of different business model decisions for markets, which may have varying levels of consumer diversity and competitive intensity at intermediate layers. For the technology provider, our key results show that a subsystem base royalty approach is the optimal business model when dealing with monopolistic intermediaries or having a low degree of consumer diversity. However, a full-system base royalty business model becomes increasingly optimal when the intermediate supply chains face competition and consumer diversity increases. We present conditions under which the technology provider may want to forward integrate. Our formulation and results are relevant to technology providers, policy makers, and industry groups engaged in the prevailing heated global discussion on royalty base.

Yet outside the most energy-intensive industries, the majority of firms approach energy as merely a cost to be managed. This is a strategic mistake that overlooks enormous opportunities to reduce risk, improve resilience, and create new value. Today energy is climbing up the corporate agenda due to sweeping environmental, social, and business trends, including climate change and global carbon regulation, increasing pressures on natural resources, rising expectations about corporate environmental performance, innovations in energy technologies and business models, and plummeting renewable energy prices. To respond to these shifts, companies must develop a robust energy strategy. This article offers a framework comprising five steps: Create a C-level mandate, integrate energy goals into the vision and operations, track progress companywide, tap new technologies, and engage stakeholders. These steps are not revolutionary—but systematically applying them to a company’s energy use is. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright 2017 Harvard Business Publishing. All Rights Reserved.

The vision of ""smart city"" has been pursued worldwide to transform urban habitats into superior efficiency, quality, and sustainability. This phenomenon prompts us to ponder what role the scholars in operations management (OM) can assume. In this essay, we express our initial thoughts on expanding OM to the smart‐city scope. We review smart‐city initiatives of governments, industry, national laboratories and academia. We argue that the smart‐city movement will transition from the tech‐oriented stage to the decision‐oriented stage. Hence, a smart city can be perceived as a system scope within which planning and operational decisions are orchestrated at the urban scale, reflective of multi‐dimensional needs, and adaptive to massive data and innovation. The benefits of studying smart‐city OM are manifold and significant: contributing to deeper understanding of smart cities by providing advanced analytical frameworks, pushing OM knowledge boundaries (such as data‐driven decision making), and empowering the OM community to deliver much broader impacts than before. We discuss several research opportunities to embody these thoughts, in the interconnected contexts of smart buildings, smart grid, smart mobility and new retail. These opportunities arise from the increasing integration of systems and business models at the urban scale.

"CEO emotions and firm valuation in initial coin offerings: An artificial emotional intelligence approach.","Momtaz, Paul P.","Strategic Management Journal (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.)",="01432095",,="Mar2021","42","3","558","21","148518079","10.1002/smj.3235","John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","Article","Chief executive officers; Valuation of corporations; Artificial intelligence; Blockchains; Cryptocurrencies; Tokens; Emotional intelligence; Facial muscles; Muscle contraction; Emotions","artificial emotional intelligence (emotion AI); CEO emotions; firm valuation; initial coin offering (ICO); upper echelons theory","Research Summary: How emotions impact firm valuation is empirically understudied because affective traits are difficult to quantify. However, using artificial emotional intelligence, positive and negative affects can be identified from facial muscle contraction‐relaxation patterns obtained from public CEO photos during initial coin offerings, that is, blockchain‐based issuances of cryptocurrency tokens to raise growth capital. The results suggest that CEO affects impact firm valuation in two ways. First, CEOs' own firm valuations conform more to those of industry peers if negative affects are pronounced (conformity mechanism). Second, investors use CEO affects as signals about firm value and discount when negative affects are salient (signaling mechanism). Both mechanisms are stronger in the presence of asymmetric information. Managerial Summary: The purpose of this paper is to advance our understanding of how CEOs' affective traits influence firm valuation by both, CEOs themselves and investors. The effect of CEO emotions is plausibly particularly pronounced for start‐up firms, whose success prospects critically depend on their leaders. My results suggest that CEO emotions impact underpricing in initial coin offerings twofold. First, negative emotions are associated with CEOs choosing an underpricing level that closely conforms to their peer firms' average. Second, investors react to negative CEO emotions by demanding higher discounts on firm value. These effects are more pronounced when there is relatively little public information about the ICO firm. My paper is accompanied by artificial emotional intelligence software for implementation in practice and future research.

For legacy firms, or firms yet to incorporate these technologies into their business models, this shift ushers in new opportunities for value creation, albeit through new capabilities. In this article, we focus on how legacy firms can embrace digital ecosystems to create value through a new capability: digital customer orientation. We define digital customer orientation as offering customized and enriched customer experiences made possible by embracing digital ecosystems. We develop a framework for legacy firms to develop capabilities for digital customer orientation in three steps: (1) by distilling key insights on how digital natives such as Amazon, Google and Facebook leverage their digital ecosystems for digital customer orientation; (2) by showing how legacy firms can apply those insights to harness their digital ecosystems and develop their own approaches for digital customer orientation; and (3) by offering a road map and a research agenda for legacy firms to engage in digital customer orientation—both by highlighting the organizational attributes needed, and by framing those attributes within the principles of transformative marketing.

What are the jobs to be done? The best entry points? How can you tell whether a company has potential for success and is the right fit for you? The author advises that you first assess whether you’re suited for a young, entrepreneurial organization. Start-up joiners need to do three things well: manage uncertainty, push the limits, and think like an owner. He then outlines four steps for choosing the right company: Pick a domain (find a field you’re passionate about); pick a city (preferably in an entrepreneurial hub); pick a stage (“jungle,” “dirt road,” or “highway”); and pick a winner (do due diligence on the founding team, the market, and the business model). Once you’ve made those choices, you’ll need to sell yourself, and Bussgang suggests how: Identify key players at the companies you’re interested in and find ways to connect with them. When you meet, articulate how you can contribute, engage your interviewers about their work, and offer expertise, advice, or contacts with no expectation of reciprocity. Suddenly you’ll be perceived as someone who is already adding value. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright 2017 Harvard Business Publishing. All Rights Reserved.

We study firms' management of radical technological change by separating their actions into upstream research (the ""R"" of R&D) and downstream development (the ""D"" of R&D). We introduce two contingencies to explain when incumbents' research investments in radical technologies translate into product development and when these upstream investments may get voided by organizational inertia downstream. First, radical technologies can differ in how they conform to incumbents' existing business models, impacting the extent to which the movement of research outputs toward development will be subject to inertial pressures. Second, incumbents can invest in a radical technology through a variety of modes (internal research, external research contracts, alliances, acquisitions). These modes represent unique combinations of who does research and who is involved in the decision for subsequent development, and, hence, differ in the extent to which they are shielded from inertial pressures. This difference helps explain why incumbents, despite responding to radical technologies, may still be unable to adapt, as well as what types of investments will be more effective in helping firms navigate technological change. Evidence from pharmaceutical incumbents' pursuit of monoclonal antibodies and gene therapy offers strong support for our arguments.

The main arguments are as follow. First, under servicizing the firm charges customers based on the product usage. Second, the quantity of products required to meet customer needs may be smaller because the firm may be able to pool customer needs. Third, the firm may have an incentive to offer products with higher efficiency. Motivated by these arguments, we investigate the economic and environmental potential of servicizing business models. We endogenize the firm's choice between a pure sales model, a pure servicizing model, and a hybrid model with both sales and servicizing options; the pricing decisions; and the resulting customer usage. We consider two extremes of pooling efficacy, i.e., no pooling versus strong pooling. We find that under no pooling servicizing leads to higher environmental impact due to production but lower environmental impact due to use. In contrast, under strong pooling, when a hybrid business model is more profitable, it is also environmentally superior. However, a pure servicizing model is environmentally inferior for high production costs because it leads to a larger production quantity even under strong pooling. We also examine the product efficiency choice and find that the firmoffers higher efficiency products only under servicizing models with strong pooling.

Intermediary organizations can enable these partnerships, but the context shapes what is needed. There is a need to understand how different contexts shape how intermediaries create value. This study fills this gap by focusing on intermediaries in Johannesburg, South Africa. We find there is significant unrealized collaborative value in the context studied. This is due to the coexistence of a limited state combined with a strong incumbent political party. While the existing scholarship on intermediaries is relevant, two particular capabilities are especially important in such a context. First, intermediaries need to focus on seizing opportunities to generate short-term value in order to build trust among partners. Second, they need to strengthen the capacity of the state through lateral influence. Weak and limited states combined with strong political regimes are common in many nations, especially those in transition. In addition, there are a variety of contemporary global political pressures that emphasize greater state autonomy. These contextual pressures make these findings particularly relevant to partnership scholars and practitioners.

Moreover, the paper examines how the three dimensions correlate with corporate financial performance. It is concluded that companies with innovative business models are more likely to address corporate sustainability and that business model innovation and corporate sustainability alike are typically found in organisations rooted in values of flexibility and discretion. Business model innovation and corporate sustainability thus seem to have their origin in the fundamental principles guiding the organisation. In addition, the study also finds a positive relationship between the core organisational values and financial performance. The analysis of the paper is based on survey responses from 492 managers within the Swedish fashion industry.

The resource-based view (RBV) of the firm and the natural resource-based view (NRBV) of the firm are revisited to lay the theoretical foundation for exploring how the social dimension might be addressed. Social capabilities are then explored by looking at the social entrepreneurship literature and illustrative cases with the purpose of elaborating RBV toward a social resource-based view (SRBV) of the firm. Three illustrative cases, which represent social businesses located in catastrophe-ridden Haiti, show how capabilities are used to overcome challenging constraints. The goal for the social entrepreneur is to employ the appropriate capabilities to ensure economic success, a positive environmental impact, and social benefits that leave the local community in a better position than without the business. Just as NRBV is a previous elaboration of RBV, so can SRBV be an elaborated theoretical foundation for future research. The components of a theory are systematically addressed by extending the range of variables (adding social capabilities), extending the domain (including stakeholders with economic, environmental, and/or social stakes), and offering propositions on variable relationships and outcome predictions (linking social capabilities and shared TBL value creation). By highlighting the social capabilities of social entrepreneurs, this research illuminates the micro-foundations of corporate social responsibility, emphasizing the value of individual level analyses.

We derive and test hypotheses concerning the cognitive antecedents of managerial intentions to embrace each of the two adaptation strategies. The results from our study of the real estate brokerage industry show that the explorative intentions are driven by opportunity perception, perceived performance-reducing threat, and risk experience. Exploitative intentions are negatively associated with perceived critical threat and industry tenure and positively associated with risk experience. We contribute to the literature on disruptive business models by combining prior research into a definable framework and by testing the cognitive influences on strategic response.

The goal of our study is to investigate how these two channels of risk interact to propagate individual defaults to a systemwide catastrophe. We formulate a constrained optimization problem that incorporates both channels of risk, and exploit the problem structure to generate the solution (to the clearing payment vector) via a partition algorithm. Through sensitivity analysis, we are able to identify two key contributors to financial systemic risk, the network multiplier and the liquidity amplifier, and to discern the qualitative difference between the two, confirming that the market liquidity effect has a great potential to cause systemwide contagion. We illustrate the network and market liquidity effects-in particular, the significance of the latter-in the formation of systemic risk with data from the European banking system. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the effectiveness of certain policy interventions. In addition, our algorithm can be used to pin down the changes of the net worth (marked to market) of each bank in the system as the spillover effect spreads, so as to estimate the extent of contagion, and to provide a metric of financial resilience as well. Our framework can also be easily extended to incorporate the effect of bankruptcy costs.

Unfortunately, one doesn't exist. However, it is possible to use the principles behind algorithms to continually retune your strategy and your organization. In online enterprises, algorithms constantly readjust the products and content shown to customers. They do this by operating three learning loops: experimentation, modulation, and shaping. Algorithms keep generating new options and testing reactions to them. But over time the algorithms modulate the rate of experimentation, scaling it back as they learn more about people's likes and dislikes. Algorithms shape preferences too, by introducing customers to products they might not have otherwise discovered. Critically, they do this all in a self-directed manner, without any human intervention. Now some internet companies have begun to regularly readjust their business models, allocation processes, and structures using the same self-directed learning loops. This approach works especially well in rapidly changing markets, like China. In this article, the authors look at how China's Alibaba grew from an 18-person start-up to an $8 billion empire by regularly resetting its vision, testing out new models, shaping opportunities, and building adaptive structures.

The answer, say A.G. Lafley and Roger L. Martin, the authors of “Customer Loyalty Is Overrated,” is rooted in serious misperceptions about the nature of competitive advantage—namely, that companies need to continually update their business models, strategies, and communications to respond to the explosion of options that sophisticated consumers face. Research suggests that what makes competitive advantage truly sustainable is helping consumers avoid having to make a choice. They choose the leading product in the market primarily because that is the easiest thing to do. And each time they select it, its advantage increases over that of the products or services they didn’t choose, creating what the authors call cumulative advantage. Lafley and Martin offer guidance for building cumulative advantage: Become popular early. Back in 1946, Procter & Gamble gave away a box of Tide with every washing machine sold in America. Design for habit. When P&G introduced Febreze, consumers liked it but didn’t use it much. The problem, it turned out, was that the product came in what looked like a glass-cleaner bottle, so users kept it under the sink. When the company redesigned the bottle so that customers would keep it in a more visible spot, they ended up using it more often. Innovate inside the brand. Efforts to “relaunch” brands can lead people to break their habits. Changes in product features should be introduced in a way that retains cumulative advantage. For customers, “improved” is much more comfortable than “new.” Keep communication simple. A clever ad may win awards, but if its message is too complex, it will backfire.

In their work, they've seen IT create new value in five patterns: using data from sensors in objects to improve offerings (think smart energy meters); digitizing physical assets (such as health records); combining data within and across industries (to, say, coordinate supply chains); trading data (as mobile providers do with information on users' whereabouts); and codifying best-in-class capabilities (such as online expense management) as services.

As they navigate its fragile and liquid institutional membranes, they prioritize cooperative forms of governance. These forms allow for collaboration and democratic decision‐making necessary for the development of innovative solutions in this new context. At the same time, the high coordination costs of cooperatives lead to significant market pressures. Therefore, understanding when and under what conditions these new cooperatives innovate and strive is important as it provides insight into whether and how these ventures can become a viable alternative in this changing landscape. Using configurational analyses of organizational enablers leading to innovation in 40 entrepreneurial cooperatives, we identify three approaches: Attentive Pack, Eclectic Troop, and Wandering Herd, showing that innovative outcomes can indeed emerge under traditional cooperative features emphasizing collectivism. However, the pursuit of higher novelty requires a shift to more individualistic, business‐as‐usual, approaches. The New Normal does indeed enhance entrepreneurial activity, but of a different kind comprising novel sets of antecedents and outcomes, which we show can easily become the new dominant form of venturing required in this new context.

In this study, we develop a game-theoretical model to analyze the effects of this sponsorship of consumer data usage. We find that the ISP's optimal network management choice of data sponsorship crucially depends on market conditions, such as the revenue rates of CPs and the fit cost of consumers. If the fit cost is low, the ISP will either allow both CPs to subsidize consumers' Internet access, or will allow only the more competitive CP to subsidize, depending on the per-consumer revenue generation rates of CPs. If the fit cost is high, it is in the ISPs interest not to allow any subsidization. We also identify conditions under which the ISP's network management choices of data sponsorship deviate from social optimum. These results should be of interest to the telecom industry as it searches additional revenue models, and to online CPs competing for customer loyalty. It should also be of interest to policymakers investigating into this issue.

It seems that large parts of our economy, including companies that are more mature and even those that operate in low-tech industries, must revise the assumptions and choices concerning their business models and value chain positions - how and where they operate - due to technological and consumer/market evolutions and discontinuities. For example, Knightian uncertainty and the need for business model experimentation characterize the digital disruptions in many industries, which necessitate a fundamental rethinking of business models and value chain composition.

We study a critical question faced by such firms in the novel context of multicategory two-sided platforms: how to optimally make investment decisions across two sides, multiple categories, and different time periods to achieve fast and sustainable growth. We first develop a two-category two-period theoretical model and propose optimal resource allocation strategies that account for heterogeneous within-category direct and indirect network effects and cross-category interdependence. We find that the proposed strategy shares the spirit of the allocation rules for multiproduct nonplatform firms and single-product platform firms, yet it does not amount to a simple combination of the existing rules. Interestingly, the business model that platforms adopt crucially determines the optimal strategy. Platforms that charge by user should adopt a ""reinforcing"" rule for both within- and cross-category allocations by allocating more resources toward the stronger growth driver. Platforms that charge by transaction should also adopt the reinforcing rule for within-category allocation, but follow a ""compensatory"" rule for cross-category and intertemporal allocations by allocating more resources toward the weaker growth driver. We use data from the daily deals industry to empirically identify the network effects, propose alternative allocation strategies stemming from our theoretical findings, and use simulations to show the benefits of these strategies. For instance, we show that reallocating 10% of the average observed investment from Fitness to Beauty can increase profits by up to 15.5% for some cities.

By analyzing a large panel data set consisting of 711 ranked mobile apps, we found that the freemium strategy is positively associated with increased sales of the paid mobile apps. Positive trial experience as represented by high review rating of the free version of a mobile app leads to higher sales of its paid version, whereas high visibility of the free version of a mobile app as represented by its product rank does not have a significant impact on the sales of its paid version. This finding suggests that although offering a free trial version is a viable way to improve the visibility of a mobile app, offering a quality free app is more important in boosting sales of the paid app. Moreover, we found that the impact of review rating is reduced when the free version is offered, or when the mobile app is a hedonic app, because consumers have the ability to experience the app themselves before purchase. These findings extend understanding of the freemium business model to include a market characterized by simultaneous intramarket competition for both the freemium and paid products and demonstrate how such dynamics may influence sales of the paid products.

In the transportation domain, car-sharing models are being adopted on a mass scale in major metropolitan areas worldwide. This mode of servicized mobility bridges the resource efficiency of public transit and the flexibility of personal transportation. Beyond the significant potential to reduce car ownership, car sharing shows promise in supporting the adoption of fuel-efficient vehicles, such as electric vehicles (EVs), because of these vehicles' special cost structure with high purchase but low operating costs. Recently, key players in the car-sharing business, such as Autolib', car2go, and DriveNow, have begun to employ EVs in an operations model that accommodates one-way trips. On the one hand (and particularly in free-floating car sharing), the one-way model results in significant improvements in coverage of travel needs and therefore in adoption potential compared with the conventional round-trip-only model (advocated by Zipcar, for example). On the other hand, this model poses tremendous planning and operational challenges. In this work, we study the planning problem faced by service providers in designing a geographical service region in which to operate the service. This decision entails trade-offs between maximizing customer catchment by covering travel needs and controlling fleet operation costs. We develop a mathematical programming model that incorporates details of both customer adoption behavior and fleet management (including EV repositioning and charging) under imbalanced travel patterns. To address inherent planning uncertainty with regard to adoption patterns, we employ a distributionally robust optimization framework that informs robust decisions to overcome possible ambiguity (or lacking) of data. Mathematically, the problem can be approximated by a mixed integer second-order cone program, which is computationally tractable with practical scale data. Applying this approach to the case of car2go's service with real operations data, we address a number of planning questions and suggest that there is potential for the future development of this service.

Open innovation involves a shift toward more open and distributed models of innovation, while platformization refers to the increasing importance of digital platforms as a venue for value creation and capture. Together, open innovation and platforms have created numerous opportunities for entrepreneurs and their firms—from serving as inputs for innovation for established firms to participating as complementors on existing platforms. While these entrepreneurial opportunities (and conditions) have manifested themselves in rich and varied ways, our understanding of these new forms of entrepreneurship has lagged behind. In this essay, and in this special issue, our objective is to bring a sharper focus on the important research issues and questions that frame open innovation, platforms, and entrepreneurship. Managerial Summary: Digital platforms and open innovation environments have unleashed numerous promising opportunities for entrepreneurs, in industries ranging from consumer software, entertainment, and home appliances to auto, health, and energy. To pursue those opportunities, however, entrepreneurs will need to gain a deeper understanding of the factors that facilitate and constrain them. In this essay, we identify and discuss several of these factors and the associated challenges and highlight the need for additional research. We also consider some of the broader contextual factors, including regulatory policies, digitization, and globalization that shape the emerging opportunities.

Furthermore, there has been no systematic analysis of the responsibilities of the high value jewellery industry and jewellery SMEs in particular. This study explores the potential for harm and value creation by individual stakeholders in fine jewellery production. Using the harm chain and institutional theory to frame our investigation, we seek to understand how small businesses within the fine jewellery industry respond to the economic, social and environmental challenges associated with responsible jewellery production, and to investigate how they perceive and negotiate the tensions between responsibility and the resistance derived from the operational norms of secrecy and autonomy within the industry. Our exploratory research provides illustrative examples of how complex harm networks operate within and across the fine jewellery industry, and demonstrates the inter-relationships that exist across the different stages of the fine jewellery harm chain. Findings suggest that institutional forces are coalescing towards a more responsible agenda for the fine jewellery industry. Moreover, while CR is a tool to disrupt harmful institutional norms and practices within such an industry, it requires the co-creation of new transformative business models and multi-stakeholder involvement including firms (SMEs and MNEs), trade associations, non-governmental organisations and consumers. Solutions include national and international legislation, price adjusted certification routes for small firms, harmonisation of industry CR standards to reduce overlap in certification and regulation and gem and precious metal 'track and trace' schemes.

We estimate the marginal economic values generated by the features of passenger matching, order cancellation, and online pay, thus shedding light on the TNC app attributions and designs. We further find that drivers underperceive the values of those features initially and need more usage experience to correct the bias. This finding demonstrates the significant role of usage experience in alleviating bias from uncertainty and supports the common industry practice of enhancing usage experience during product introduction. Our study also shows that the substantial value of early promotion not only encourages current usage but also fosters learning that sustains drivers' continued use of the app. Additional insights that, for example, cashback for passengers affects the decisions of drivers, and platform subsidy and bids from passengers might signal low quality of service can help the managers of newly introduced products better design sales promotions in a more effective way. The mobile app of a transportation network company (TNC) has reshaped the taxi business model by providing new features and allowing the TNC platform to run a diverse two-sided sales promotion to help introduce those new features. We investigate the economic value of this app and how drivers build an initial preference for passenger matching, the cancellation feature, and online pay as well as how a two-sided sales promotion affects drivers' willingness to use the TNC app. We estimate a structural model of drivers' decisions to accept orders and to cancel generated orders and their perception of passengers' willingness to utilize a sales promotion. Bayesian learning processes are introduced to account for drivers' learning new features. We find evidence of the economic value of new features on a TNC app and drivers' learning about the value of those features. Our results show that a platform subsidy and bids from passengers might signal low quality of service, and that platform cashback to passengers has a positive effect on drivers by increasing drivers' chances of being rewarded. Our results further indicate that the substantial value of early promotion not only encourages current usage but also fosters learning that sustains drivers' continued use of the app, and show how cashback for passengers affects the decisions of drivers. Finally, our policy simulations show improved performance with regard to drivers' willingness to use the app as well as its cost effectiveness.

Based on a sample of 47 banks (30 full-fledged Islamic banks and 17 Islamic Shariah-windows) operating in different regions during the 2005–2010 period, and controlling for firm-specific characteristics, this paper finds investments in human capital to have a significant positive impact on the market value in the pre- and post-financial crisis period. Based on a market measure, this paper finds board size and CEO power to have a significant positive impact, while the size of Shariah Supervisory Board (SSB) has the opposite effect on market performance. The results further reveal that the Islamic banking sector is not a homogeneous group, with full-fledged Islamic banks having lax corporate governance mechanisms and large size, while their counterparts, Islamic Shariah-windows, having strong corporate governance mechanisms tend to invest more in human capital to yield positive market value. Overall, the analysis suggests that the financial crisis may have further spurred the impact of investments in human capital on the market performance.

Software as a Service has distinctive characteristics of disruptive innovations that typically create several difficulties for incumbent firms, in particular with regard to adapting business models. To date, however, little empirical understanding exists regarding the dynamics of business model change - a topic of special importance to the highly dynamic software industry, which is characterised by rapid and regular emergence of disruptive innovations. As disruptive innovations require gathering distant knowledge and experimenting with new ideas, this study addresses theoretical gaps regarding the role of absorptive capacity and organisational ambidexterity in the process of business model change owing to the emergence of a disruptive innovation. Drawing on evidence from multiple case studies of six incumbent vendors of enterprise resource-planning software and informed by a thorough review of related secondary data, we investigate the pace and path of incumbents' business model adaptations. We propose a theoretical model that refines prior literature on absorptive capacity and organisational ambidexterity, particularly with regard to the process of business model change. This study identifies further technological factors that determine how and why incumbents change business models. In addition, our study provides in-depth insights on the technological trajectory of enterprise resource-planning software switching from on-premise to on-demand software services. © 2016 Blackwell Publishing Ltd [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Information Systems Journal is the property of Wiley-Blackwell and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

But, not all incumbents perform better after adding new business models to their existing ones; that raises the question about the conditions under which adding a new business model improves incumbent performance. We develop a theoretical framework to address that question. After identifying two types of incumbent assets, complementary and conflicting, we highlight the influence of two managerial choices-timing and organizational mode of the new business model addition-that create opportunities to translate the potential provided by incumbent assets into higher performance. The proposed discriminating alignment thesis states that incumbent performance after new business model addition improves when the incumbent firm aligns complementary assets with earlier addition of the new business model and conflicting assets with an autonomous business unit for the new business model. To test these hypotheses, we analyzed the performance change of those physical store-based retailers that added online retailing as a new business model. The test results supported all hypotheses, and key theoretical and managerial implications are presented. Copyright © 2015 Strategic Management Society.

That’s the contention of the authors, who say that a steady flow of profits from manageable ventures will pave the way for later investments in more-ambitious socially beneficial projects. The authors cite two main challenges in selling profitably to the bottom of the pyramid: changing consumers’ behavior and changing the way products are made and delivered. To help companies see how these challenges affect various business prospects, they have developed an “opportunity map” that classifies opportunities along a spectrum from the least complex and resource-intensive to the most. At the simplest end are targeted marketing opportunities in mature markets. In the middle are opportunities in growth markets: efforts to redesign products, extend distribution channels, or create new ones. At the other end of the spectrum are frontier-market ventures to develop new products, conquer competitors’ markets, expand into greenfield markets, develop new business models, or create altogether new markets. The authors present examples of each type and explain that companies can pursue multiple opportunities simultaneously. If they choose wisely, they can make profits and advance their social missions at the same time. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright 2014 Harvard Business Publishing. All Rights Reserved.

The purpose of this study is to determine levels of commitment to corporate sustainability in marketing, processes associated with sustainability marketing commitment, drivers of sustainability marketing at the functional level of marketing, and its organizational context. Using survey data from 269 managers in marketing, covering a broad range of industries in Sweden and Denmark, we took a structural modelling approach to examine construct relationships, mediation, and moderation effects. Overall, the findings show that marketing capabilities associated with the innovation of new products, services, and business models constitute a strong driver to leverage sustainability marketing commitment. In conjunction with insights into processes related to the enactment of sustainability marketing, this result indicates that companies' marketing departments have a propensity to drive corporate sustainability. The study provides substance to the idea of aligning substantive marketing capabilities closer to dynamic capabilities. Accordingly, the study reveals that reliance on market orientation alone does not lead to greater sustainability commitment.

Previous studies have framed the challenges facing entrepreneurs in mature organizational fields as avoiding the power of overbearing regulators long enough to establish the legitimacy of their ventures. In fields typified by New Normal conditions, however, regulatory frameworks for evaluating new technology‐enabled ventures are often still lacking. Regulators may choose to actively reach out to entrepreneurs to arrive at a better understanding of the radical technological changes and high‐frequency entrepreneurial behavioural adaptations that occur in these settings. To grasp how novel regulatory institutional structures come about in the New Normal business landscape, we conducted a processual study of the emergence of a new technology that is the Dutch remotely piloted aircraft systems (drone) industry between 2000 and 2018. Our findings show that regulatory proto‐institutions result from dialectic institutional work in the form of structured interactions between entrepreneurs and regulators. Specifically, we present a process model that reveals how new regulatory structures evolve in contexts where high levels of technological and behavioural change induce systemic uncertainty, and enlarge the interdependence between entrepreneurs and regulators. We suggest that our process theory of proto‐institutional emergence generalizes towards other organizational fields in which technology‐enabled entrepreneurship has become the main driver of growth. Theoretically, our findings speak to the literatures on institutional work, proto‐institutional emergence, and the New Normal business landscape.

We also highlight the characteristics of Google's existing synergetic data practices that will shape the development of not only Google Glass, but also all subsequent wearable mobile devices in light of 360-degree data collection. The key organizing concept of our study is the disjuncture between (1) institutional and (2) policy forces in harnessing dual market mechanism, which frames how the new communication industry operates in the marketplace of ubiquitous personal advertising.

It inevitably requires understanding the dynamics of platforms and ecosystems. These challenges are amplified for enabling technologies, which are the central focus of this article. The innovator of an enabling technology has a special business model challenge because the applicability to many downstream verticals forecloses, as a practical matter, ownership of all the relevant complements. Complementary assets (vertical and lateral) in the digital context are no longer just potential value-capture mechanisms (through asset price appreciation or through preventing exposure to monopolistic bottleneck pricing by others); they may well be needed simply for the technology to function. Technological and innovational complementors present both coordination and market design challenges to the innovator that generally lead to market failure in the form of an excess of social over private returns. The low private return leads to socially sub-optimal underinvestment in future R&D that can be addressed to some extent by better strategic decision-making by the innovator and/or by far-sighted policies from government and the judiciary. The default value-capture mechanism for many enabling technologies is the licensing of trade secrets and/or patents. Licensing is shown to be a difficult business model to implement from a value-capture perspective. When injunctions for intellectual property infringement are hard to win, or even to be considered, the incentives for free riding by potential licensees are considerable. Licensing is further complicated if it involves standard essential patents, as both courts and policy makers may fail to understand that development of a standard involves components of both interoperability and technology development. If a technology standard is not treated as the embodiment of significant R&D efforts enabling substantial new downstream economic activity, then rewards are likely to be calibrated too low to support appropriate levels of future innovation.

Because the unique selling mechanism combines features of shopping and online auction, consumers expect both monetary return and entertainment value from their participation. We propose a dynamic structural model to analyze consumer behaviors on entertainment shopping websites. The model captures the consumer learning process, based both on individual participation experiences and also on observational learning of historical auction information. We estimate the model using a large data set from an online entertainment shopping website. Results show that consumers' initial participation incentives mainly come from a significant overestimation of the entertainment value and an obvious underestimation of the auction competition. Both types of learning contribute to a general decreasing participation trend among consumers over time. Our model provides both a theoretical explanation and empirical evidence of the consumer churn issue. It further identifies two groups of consumers with different risk characteristics: One group is risk-averse and quits using the website before effective learning takes place, while the other group exhibits risk-seeking behavior and overly commits to the auction games. Based on the estimated parameters of the model, we perform counterfactual analyses to evaluate the effects of policy changes on consumers' participation behaviors. We discuss several important design implications and recommend strategies for building a sustainable business model in the entertainment shopping industry.

Existing IT tools supporting the process of designing, innovating, and evaluating a company's business model are currently not leveraging the full potential of tool support, because they do not make use of theoretical and empirical knowledge around business model development. Against this backdrop, we analyze existing knowledge on business model design and management, resulting in a first systematization of the activities that are necessary for developing and managing new business models. In order to complement this knowledge and to identify the requirements for supporting these activities, a series of expert interviews is conducted. Based on the results of the interview series, a new business model development tool is created and evaluated. The learnings of this development process are then consolidated in a unified framework. This framework constitutes a new solution for systematically designing tool support for business model development and extends existing literature by highlighting the importance of collaboration between participants in a business model development project. It also provides designers of new business model development tool with an empirically based conceptualization to guide their efforts.

We examine the effectiveness of such decentralized platforms for harnessing the wisdom and effort of the crowd. We find that τ-weighting generally discourages truthful voting and erodes the platform's predictive power unless users are ""strategic enough"" to unravel the underlying aggregation mechanism. Platform accuracy decreases with the number of truthful users and the dispersion in their token holdings, and in many cases, platforms would be better off with a ""flat"" 1/n mechanism. When, prior to voting, strategic users can exert effort to endogenously improve their signals, users with more tokens generally exert more effort—a feature often touted in marketing materials as a core advantage of τ-weighting—however, this feature is not attributable to the mechanism itself, and more importantly, the ensuing equilibrium fails to achieve the first-best accuracy of a centralized platform. The optimality gap decreases as the distribution of tokens across users approaches a theoretical optimum, which we derive, but tends to increase with the dispersion in users' token holdings.

This study addresses this gap and builds on Strategic Niche Management and the Multi-level Perspective to distinguish two different niche actors: prosumers on the demand-side applying a niche innovation in a disruptive way to regime incumbents' business model, and new entrants on the supply-side applying the niche innovation symbiotically with the regime. We examine incumbent responses to these different niche actors in different competitive and policy environments. Studying the United States' electricity industry's sustainability transition toward solar from 2010-2017, we find that as more niche actors enter, regime incumbents are more likely to invest in the niche innovation, but the effect is influenced by policy and competitiveness of the environment. In competitive environments, incumbents are more likely to respond to disruptive niche actors (prosumers), while in traditional monopoly-like markets they are more likely to respond to symbiotic niche actors. We also find that the prosumer effect is stronger when the time that policies in support of the niche innovation have existed is shorter, indicating a potential substituting relationship of niche actors and policy. Our work contributes to the extant literature by demonstrating that the interplay between different niche actors needs to be understood within the context of policy, and that considering policy without accounting for the competitive environment may omit an important aspect of how regime actors become active participants in sustainability transitions.

This study is motivated by a regulatory policy implemented by the Chinese government in 2017 and a similar policy approved by the New York City Council in 2018 that regulate the ""maximum"" number of registered Uber/DiDi drivers. We examine the impact of these policies on the welfare of different stakeholders (i.e., consumers, taxi drivers, on-demand ride service company, and independent drivers). By analyzing a two-period dynamic game that involves these stakeholders, we find that, without government intervention, the on-demand ride service platform can drive the traditional taxi industry out of the market under certain conditions. Relative to no regulations and a complete ban policy, a carefully designed regulatory policy can strike a better balance of multiple competing objectives. Finally, if a government can reform the taxi industry by adjusting the taxi fare, then lowering the taxi fare instead of imposing a strict policy toward on-demand ride services can improve the total social welfare.

Research on scaling has generally focused on organizational characteristics often overlooking factors at the individual level that may affect scaling decisions. Drawing on the multidimensional construct of moral intensity, we propose a theoretical model of ethical decision making to explain why a social entrepreneur's perception of moral intensity of the social problem, coupled with their personal desire for control, can significantly influence scaling decisions. Specifically, we propose that higher levels of perceived moral intensity will positively influence the likelihood of scaling through open as opposed to closed modes in order to achieve greater speed and scope of social impact. However, we also propose this effect will be negatively moderated by a social entrepreneur's higher levels of desire for control. Our model has implications for research and practice at the interface of ethics and social entrepreneurship.

We focus on the challenge of incumbents pursuing both models simultaneously during the nascent period, and the implications on their firms' valuations. Our theory is premised on the adjustment costs incurred by incumbents associated with the sharing of resources across business models and the conflict between managers vying for limited resources. While firms' assets and competitive environments are key drivers of their value, we argue that they also impact adjustment costs. Evidence from the U.S. electric utility industry, which is undergoing a change from a centralized to a decentralized model, offers strong support for our arguments. The greater the level of incumbents' assets that are specific to the existing model, and the greater the level of competition that they face, the lower are their firms' valuations when investing in the new model relative to when investing in the existing model. Hence, ironically, those incumbents potentially most threatened by the change seem to be least rewarded for their efforts to renew themselves. However, pursuing the new model via alliances can help mitigate adjustment costs. The study uncovers the challenges that incumbents face as they pursue the new model in tandem with the existing dominant model, and helps explain why some incumbents may successfully navigate the changing industry landscape while others may stumble.

"The Impact of Online Platforms’ Revenue Model on Consumers’ Ethical Inferences.","Su, Yi; Jin, Liyin","Journal of Business Ethics",="01674544",,="Apr2021",,,"1",,"149610239","10.1007/s10551-021-04798-0","Springer Nature","Article",,"Business model; Company ethics; Consumer inference; Consumer-serving motive; Ethical perception","This research examines the impact of an online platform’s revenue model on consumers’ ethical inferences of the company. We demonstrate that consumers perceive online platforms that employ the advertising-based revenue model to be less ethical than platforms that employ the service-fee-based revenue model because platforms that adopt the advertising-based revenue model are thought to be less consumer-serving motivated (Study 1). The unfavorable ethical inferences induced by the advertising-based revenue model further lower consumers’ intention to disclose personal information and the intention to generate positive word of mouth for the company (Study 2 and Study 3). We further find that allowing consumers to skip advertisements (Study 4) does not improve the less favorable ethical inferences while using resources for public-service advertisements does (Study 5). These findings advance the understanding of consumers’ ethical inferences regarding business models and provide insights for managers to develop effective strategies to alleviate less favorable ethical inferences.

While the ecosystem services narrative is being forwarded globally as a key paradigm for promoting business sustainability, there is scarce knowledge of how these issues are considered at managerial level. This study thus investigates managerial views of corporate sustainability after the ecosystem services concept. We analyse interviews conducted with 20 managers from domestic and international forestry companies operating with a plantation-based business model in China. Content analysis was employed to analyse the data, with a focus on four key areas: (1) interviewee familiarity with the ecosystem services concept; (2) their views of corporate dependencies and impacts on ecosystem services; (3) related business risks and opportunities; and (4) viability of existing instruments and practices that can be employed in detecting and addressing business impacts and dependencies on ecosystem services. Through an inductive approach to the empirical findings, we refined a framework that holds operational value for developing company response strategies to ecosystem services impact/dependence assessment, ensuring that all issues are addressed comprehensively, and that related risks and opportunities are properly acknowledged.

Business model innovation in the public sector is important in creating value for citizens, industry, and government. The differing priorities of these stakeholders, which often require intervention or unification to address a societal need, are at the heart of both supply-side and demand-side strategy research. Moreover, it represents a core element of the business model innovation delivering a key commodity, liquid petroleum gas (LPG), to large populations in the developing world. In this paper, we examine varying conditions in the public sector that require both supply-side and demand-side business model innovation for value creation, capture, and appropriation through deployment of digital government initiatives and policy interventions. By analysing the Indian LPG industry over a 70-year period, we argue that the supply-side and demand-side perspective, along with the business model concept, promote a better understanding of government industry interventions in the interest of all stakeholders. Specifically, the contribution of this paper to the public sector is unique, because (i) research on demand-side strategy can help business model scholars gain a more robust, granular understanding of effective value propositions for citizens, (ii) supply-side strategy business models create a seamless delivery mechanism, and (iii) both supply-side and demand-side strategy with their unique propositions serve as a ""bridging concept"" in coming up with the Framework for the Customer-Integrated Public Sector Business Model that connects the shared ideas of both areas of study to resource-based streams of strategy research.

In reality, however, established and new software vendors are battling to redefine their offering to embrace PaaS. They face the challenges of transforming, configuring and calibrating their PaaS business models to align them with existing business models, customer expectations and competitive pressures. This motivates our research question: How can software providers design viable business models for PaaS? Our study develops a design theory for PaaS business models. This theory is grounded on a 12-month action design research study at one of the largest global software companies (here called Alpha) with mixed PaaS experiences in the past. Our primary research contribution is a set of design principles that guide software providers to define a viable PaaS business model in order to create a flourishing software ecosystem for their cloud platform. By synthesizing prescriptive knowledge related to business model design for emerging cloud platforms, our study advances PaaS research towards the existing body of research on software platforms and business models.

Thus, we ask: ""What is the optimal choice of revenue model?"" Using a novel theory‐building method combining machine learning and multi‐case theory building, we unpack optimal revenue model choice for a wide range of products on the App Store. Our primary theoretical contribution is a framework of high‐performing revenue model‐activity system configurations. Our core insight is the fit between value capture (revenue models) and value creation (activities) at the heart of successful business models. Contrastingly, low‐performing products avoid complex value capture (i.e., freemium) and misunderstand value creation (e.g., overweight effort). Overall, we contribute a theoretically accurate and empirically grounded view of successful business models using a pioneering method for theory building using large, quantitative data sets. Managerial Summary: Revenue models are critical for product performance. Yet, the high‐performing choice is often unclear. We combine machine learning with multiple‐case deep‐dives to unpack optimal revenue model choice for a wide range of products on the App Store, a significant setting in the digital economy. Our primary insight is that high‐performing products fit value capture (revenue models) and value creation (activity systems) to form coherent business models. Contrastingly, low‐performing products avoid complex value capture (i.e., freemium) and misunderstand value creation (e.g., overweight effort and price). We also identify the importance of user resources, marketing, offline brand, and product complexity for specific revenue models. Overall, we contribute a framework for the optimal choice of revenue model and spotlight the revenue model‐activity system configurations of successful business models.

Stall-out occurs when the growth engine that powered companies to success stops working. This rarely happens because the business model has suddenly become obsolete—a common misconception. Rather, research by Zook and Allen shows that the business has almost always become too complex, most often owing to bureaucracy that slows the company’s metabolism, or internal dysfunction that distorts information and hampers managers’ ability to make rapid decisions and take swift action on them. But stall-out can be overcome. The authors find that most companies that achieve sustainable growth share attitudes and behaviors: (1) They view themselves as business insurgents, fighting in behalf of underserved customers; (2) they have an obsession with the front line, where the business meets the customer; and (3) they foster a mindset that includes a deep sense of responsibility for how resources are used and for long-term results. Those qualities can help any company restart its growth engine by removing gunk and complexity that have built up over the years, inhibiting the clean execution of strategy.

To this end, we have collected the firms’ significant innovations and classified them by Schumpeterian types, patented and non-patented and domestic and imported. The number of patents registered by the firms throughout their lifetime −a rough measure of their incremental innovation activity– has also been recorded. In addition, twelve control variables −five characteristics of the firms and seven of their business leaders– have been included. Both log-normal and gamma duration models have been used in the analysis. They have been estimated, firstly for the whole set of firms and, secondly, for the manufacturing and the service firms separately to control for industry differences. The results of the log-normal and gamma estimations are highly coincident, with some nuances. The significant innovations −particularly new processes, non-patented and domestic ones– have been found to positively influence the probability of business survival. The number of patent applications seems to increase the survival probability of the manufacturing firms, but not of the service ones. Among the control variables, the firm’s size, its international dimension, and the age of the business leader at entry seem to be the most influential ones on business survival, although there are some differences between manufacturing and services. The main results are robust to the division of the sample by entry period.

Many believe that these multi-sided digital platforms will become key enablers of the digital transformation of healthcare in the United States. However, like other entrepreneurial ventures, HIEs face challenges to achieve operational maturity and financial viability. Entrepreneurial ventures often fail to attain financial viability due to the initial design of the business model and the inability to evolve the model over time. We focus on the influence of service offerings, revenue models, and their evolution on the viability of HIEs. Using a unique archival dataset constructed from surveys of HIEs in the United States from 2008 to 2010, we find that providing an extensive service bundle may lead to higher operational maturity with the HIE's increasing age, but this may deter the HIE's potential to achieve financial viability. The findings also show that the influence of service offerings on financial viability is mediated by operational maturity. Qualitative evidence corroborates these findings and suggests that HIEs need to move from providing a set of foundational services to offering more advanced services as they evolve and that they need to appropriately bundle the services using transaction-, subscription- or mixed-fee models. We discuss how these findings contribute to research at the intersection of operations management and information systems and offer important implications for HIEs with regard to crafting and evolving appropriate service offerings and revenue models.

In particular, we focus on two emerging software business models that involve a free component: feature-limited freemium (FLF) and uniform seeding (S). Under FLF, the firm offers the basic software version for free, while charging for premium features. Under S, the firm gives away for free the full product to a percentage of the addressable market uniformly across consumer types. We benchmark their performance against a conventional business model under which software is sold as a bundle (labeled as ""charge for everything"" or CE) without free offers. In the context of consumer bounded rationality and information asymmetry, we develop a unified two-period consumer valuation learning framework that accounts for both word-of-mouth (WOM) effects and experience-based learning, and use it to compare and contrast the three business models. Under both constant and dynamic pricing, for moderate strength of WOM signals, we derive the equilibria for each model and identify optimality regions. In particular, S is optimal when consumers significantly underestimate the value of functionality and cross-module synergies are weak. When either cross-module synergies are stronger or initial priors are higher, the firm decides between CE and FLF. Furthermore, we identify nontrivial switching dynamics from one optimality region to another depending on the initial consumer beliefs about the value of the embedded functionality. For example, there are regions where, ceteris paribus, FLF is optimal when the prior on premium functionality is either relatively low or high, but not in between. We also demonstrate the robustness of our findings with respect to various parameterizations of cross-module synergies, strength of WOM effects, and number of periods. We find that stronger WOM effects or more periods lead to an expansion of the seeding optimality region in parallel with a decrease in the seeding ratio. Moreover, under CE and dynamic pricing, second period price may be decreasing in the initial consumer valuation beliefs when WOM effects are strong and the prior is relatively low. However, this is not the case under weak WOM effects. We also discuss regions where price skimming and penetration pricing are optimal. Our results provide key managerial insights that are useful to firms in their business model search and implementation.

Starting from the foundations of neoclassical economics, we model entrepreneurial entry and competition as occurring simultaneously in production technology space and product attribute space. Our model's central feature is to disaggregate entrepreneurial rents into four components: arbitrage, innovation, organization, and uncertainty‐bearing. This permits us to model the nature of value creation from a common analytical platform, and to measure value capture as a set of distinct rent streams available to multiple stakeholders over time. Managerial Summary : Although there is broad consensus that the essence of entrepreneurship is the creation and capture of new value, both scholars and practitioners have struggled to connect this basic exhortation to the entrepreneurial process. This paper argues that returns to entrepreneurial action can be generated through four main mechanisms: innovation, uncertainty‐bearing, new business models, or inter‐industry arbitrage—either uniquely, or in combination. Examining these mechanisms for value creation together reveals implications for how best to organize and manage the entrepreneurial process so that that returns to entrepreneurial action can be appropriated equitably.

Although extant literature offers important insights into platform management from a platform-owner perspective, we know little about how organizations manage industry platforms provided by external parties to generate opportunities and overcome challenges in relation to their infrastructure and work processes. As part of larger ecosystems, these digital platforms offer organizations bundles of digital options that they can selectively invest in over time. At the same time, organizations' previous investments in digital infrastructure and work processes produce a legacy of digital debt that conditions how they manage their digital platforms over time. Against this backdrop, we investigate how digital options and digital debt were implicated in a large Scandinavian media organization's management of a news production platform over nearly 17 years. Drawing on extant literature and the findings from this case, we theorize the progression of and interactions between digital options and digital debt during an organization's digital platform management in relation to its infrastructure and work processes. The theory reveals the complex choices that organizations face in such efforts: While they may have to resolve digital debt to make a platform's digital options actionable, hesitancy to plant digital debt may equally well prevent them from realizing otherwise attractive digital options. Similarly, while identified digital options may offer organizations new opportunities to resolve digital debt, eagerness to realize digital options may just as easily lead to unwise planting of digital debt.

Competition from Microsoft's Encarta in 1993 led to sharp declines in the sales of books, which led to the distressed sale of the firm in 1996. This article offers new source material about the actions at both Encarta and Britannica, and it offers a novel interpretation of events. Britannica's management did not misperceive the opportunities and threats, and Britannica did not lack technical prowess. This narrative stresses that Britannica's management faced organizational diseconomies of scope between supporting lines of business in the old and new markets, which generated internal conflicts. These conflicts hindered the commercialization of new technology and hastened its decline. Managerial summary: An established and leading firm, such as Encyclopædia Britannica, would seem to have enormous advantages over its competitors in a new market. Why would a successful firm come to have severe difficulties organizing for a new market? Of particular importance for explaining Britannica's decline are theories that stress its inherited capabilities, especially inherited technological (in)abilities and inherited (mis)perceptions about the potential for new market opportunities. This article argues that Britannica's management did not misperceive the opportunities and threats, and Britannica did not lack technical prowess. This narrative stresses that Britannica's management faced organizational diseconomies of scope between supporting lines of business in the old and new markets, which generated internal conflicts. The narrative directs attention at managing commercialization activity around new products using new technologies. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Abstract This study explores the channels through which technological investments affect productivity performance of industrialized economies. Using a Stochastic Frontier Model (SFM) we estimate the productivity effects of R&D and ICT for a large sample of OECD industries between 1973 and 2007, identifying four channels of transmission: input accumulation, technological change, technical efficiency and spillovers. Our results show that ICT has been particularly effective in reducing production inefficiency and in generating inter-industry spillovers, while R&D has raised the rate of technical change and favoured knowledge spillovers within sectors. We also quantify the contribution of technological investments to output and total factor productivity growth documenting that R&D and ICT accounted for almost 95% of productivity growth in the OECD area.

"Is Integrated Reporting Really the Superior Mechanism for the Integration of Ethics into the Core Business Model? An Empirical Analysis.","Maniora, Janine","Journal of Business Ethics",="01674544",,="Feb2017","140","4","755","32","121920087","10.1007/s10551-015-2874-z","Springer Nature","Article","Integrated reporting (Corporation reports); Social responsibility of business; Accounting ethics; Disclosure in accounting; Decision making in accounting","Business model; Corporate social responsibility; ESG performance; Ethical accounting; Ethics; Integrated reporting; Integrated thinking; Integration of ESG issues; Non-financial disclosure; Reporting strategies; Sustainability reporting","This paper examines the impact of integrated reporting (IR) on the integration of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues into the business model and the related economic and ESG performance changes. To investigate these internal and external transformational effects of IR, important differences between IR and alternative ESG reporting strategies are worked out. Using three matched samples of companies from around the world for the sample period 2002–2011, IR companies are matched with companies applying (a) no ESG reporting, (b) stand-alone ESG reporting, or (c) ESG reporting in the annual report. The results suggest that IR is a superior mechanism only for the integration of ESG issues into the core business model when comparing IR with the ESG reporting strategies of (a) no ESG reporting and (c) ESG reporting in annual reports. In comparison with (b), stand-alone ESG reporting, the results indicate that IR is negatively associated with the ESG integration level and with the economic and ESG performance. Moreover, this negative impact is lower for companies that have already implemented ESG management tools prior to the initiation of IR and is stronger for companies residing in countries with legal requirements for the disclosure of ESG information. A separate change analysis reveals that companies do not benefit from a switch from stand-alone ESG reporting to IR. Thus, this paper provides empirical evidence that contradicts the general notion of IR as a superior reporting mechanism, as the benefits of IR are driven by several factors.

To facilitate research on the Bright Internet, we explicitly define the goals and principles of the Bright Internet, and review the evolution of its principles. The three goals of the Bright Internet are: the realization of preventive security, the provision of the freedom of anonymous expression for innocent netizens, and protection from the risk of privacy infringement that may be caused by preventive security schemes. We respecify design principles to fulfill these seemingly conflicting goals: origin responsibility, deliverer responsibility, identifiable anonymity, global collaboration, and privacy protection. Research for the Bright Internet is characterized by two perspectives: first, the Bright Internet adopts a preventive security paradigm in contrast to the current self-centric defensive protective security paradigm. Second, the target of research is the development and deployment of the Bright Internet on a global scale, which requires the design of technologies and protocols, policies and legislation, and international collaboration and global governance. This research contrasts with behavioral research on individuals and organizations in terms of the protective security paradigm. This paper proposes validation research concerning the principles of the Bright Internet using prevention motivation theory and analogical social norm theory, and demonstrates the need for a holistic and prescriptive design for a global scale information infrastructure, encompassing the constructs of technologies, policies and global collaborations. An important design issue concerns the business model design, which is capable of promoting the propagation of the Bright Internet platform through applications such as Bright Cloud Extended Networks and Bright E-mail platforms. Our research creates opportunities for prescriptive experimental research, and the various design and behavioral studies of the Bright Internet open new horizons toward our common goal of a bright future.

For the past century economists have proposed a suite of theories relating to industrial dynamics, technological change and innovation. There has been an implication in these models that the institutional environment is stable. However, a new class of institutional technologies—most notably blockchain technology—lower the cost of institutional entrepreneurship along these margins, propelling a process of institutional evolution. This presents a new type of innovation process, applicable to the formation and development of institutions for economic governance and coordination. This paper develops a replicator dynamic model of institutional innovation and proposes some implications of this innovation for innovation policy. Given the influence of public policies on transaction costs and associated institutional choices, it is indicated that policy settings conductive to the adoption and use of blockchain technology would elicit entrepreneurial experiments in institutional forms harnessing new coordinative possibilities in economic exchange. Conceptualisation of blockchain-related public policy an innovation policy in its own right has significant implications for the operation and understanding of open innovation systems in a globalised context.

We develop a queueing-game-theoretic model that captures the interaction among customers, the line-sitting firm, and the service provider to examine the impact of line-sitting on the service provider's revenue and customer welfare. We also contrast line-sitting with the well-known priority purchasing scheme, as both allow customers to pay extra to skip the wait. Our main results are as follows. First, we find that both accommodating line-sitting and selling priority can bring in extra revenue for the service provider, although by different means—selling priority increases revenue mainly by allowing the service provider to practice price discrimination that extracts more customer surplus, whereas line-sitting does so through demand expansion, attracting customers who would not otherwise join. Second, the priority purchasing scheme tends to make the customer population worse off, whereas line-sitting can be a win–win proposition for both the service provider and the customers. Nevertheless, having the additional option of hiring line-sitters does not always benefit customers as a whole because the demand expansion effect also induces negative congestion externalities. Finally, despite the fact that the service provider collects the priority payment as revenue but not the line-sitting payment, which accrues to the third-party line-sitting firm, we demonstrate that, somewhat surprisingly, accommodating line-sitting can raise more revenue for the service provider than directly selling priority.

Across industries, sellers are changing their business models from a simple goods orientation to a hybrid goods-services model, placing greater emphasis on delivering complete customer solutions. In such an environment, companies must find ways to prioritize investments in resource development. The service-dominant (S-D) logic framework offers significant insights into this challenge; however, these effects have not been tested quantitatively. This study addresses that gap, examining the influence of various seller resources on buyer satisfaction. An empirical analysis of buying organizations that purchased and implemented business intelligence systems finds that 'augmented' operant resources that the buyers ascribe to the software's sellers-resources that go above and beyond expectations-are the most significant predictors of both successful technology assimilation and overall customer relationship quality. In particular, an augmented operant resource reflecting a seller's ability to see value creation opportunities from the buyer's perspective ( value mindset) has up to three times the effect on relationship satisfaction as 'core' operant resources such as product-specific expertise or basic interpersonal service skills. These results can help sellers prioritize resource investments.

It presents a clear definition of the ecosystem construct, a grammar for characterizing ecosystem structure, and a characterization of the distinctive aspects of ecosystem strategy. This approach offers an explicit examination of the relationship among ecosystems and a host of alternative constructs (business models, platforms, coopetition, multisided markets, networks, technology systems, supply chains, value networks) that helps characterize where the ecosystem construct adds, and does not add, insight for the strategy literature.

In addition, we propose three perspectives that can differentiate Bright ICT research from traditional research approaches to create a disruptive impact on society. To address societal problems that are often global in scope, Bright ICT research recommends taking a holistic design of future society encompassing technologies and policies as well as business models driven by visionary principles. This paradigm can be an extension of design science for the scope of a Macro Information Society.

Using data on open source software, we show that motivations are diverse, and demonstrate how managers can strategically influence the flow of code contributions and their impact on project performance. Unlike previous literature using survey data, we exploit the observed pattern of project membership and code contributions-the 'revealed preference' of developers-to infer the motivations driving their decision to contribute. Developers strongly sort along key dimensions of the business model chosen by project managers, especially the degree of openness of the project license. The results indicate an important role for intrinsic motivation, reputation, and labor market signaling, and a more limited role for reciprocity. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The main hypothesis is that there are two major types of banking institutions: conventional banks and ethical banks. Each has a distinct business model. To test how they have reacted to the new environment, factor analysis techniques have been used. The main findings are twofold. Firstly, the new financial context has indeed caused the behavior of mainstream banks to change. Within this group, one can further distinguish between those that have tried to anticipate the changes by adopting a more responsible financial attitude and those that have merely modified their banking practice to comply with the new regulatory framework. Secondly, there are the so-called ethical banks. Interestingly, their behavior has scarcely been altered by the new financial context. The main conclusion is that the different response of both types of banks reflects the existence of a distinct business model.

In this paper, we study the impact of two major barriers to mass adoption of EVs: (i) range anxiety, the concern that the driving range of EVs may be insufficient to meet the driving needs, and (ii) resale anxiety, the concern that used values of EVs may deteriorate quickly. Using a stylized model calibrated to a data set based on the San Francisco Bay Area, we show that although both types of consumer anxieties typically harm the firm's profit, they often improve consumer surplus. In addition, we show that a business model that requires consumers to lease the EV batteries (rather than purchase them) may lead to a greater level of adoption and emission savings when the level of resale anxiety is high. Further, a business model that offers EV range improvement through enhanced charging infrastructure typically yields greater adoption and consumer surplus, but lowers the firm's profit, compared with one that offers enlarged batteries. Overall, we find that the combinations of battery owning/leasing with enhanced charging service, referred to as the 4O1E5 and 4L1E5 models in our paper, typically yield the best balance among the objectives of EV adoption, emission savings, profitability, and consumer surplus, when the degree of resale anxiety is low and high, respectively.

Specifically, the conceptual similarities and differences of entrepreneurial ecosystems relative to, for instance, clusters, “knowledge clusters,” regional systems of innovation, and “innovative milieus” remain unclear. Drawing on research on industrial districts and agglomerations, clusters, and systems of innovation, we suggest that entrepreneurial ecosystems differ from traditional clusters by their emphasis on the exploitation of digital affordances; by their organization around entrepreneurial opportunity discovery and pursuit; by their emphasis on business model innovation; by voluntary horizontal knowledge spillovers; and by cluster‐external locus of entrepreneurial opportunities.

However, despite the large representation and growth of this business model, the resolution of key contractual provisions is still regarded as idiosyncratic, and little is known about how experience with prior relationships or bargaining power position affects contract outcomes. In an attempt to further understand how these transactions unfold, we present and test a theoretical framework disentangling experience benefits and transaction costs associated with licensors' prior involvement in out- versus in-licensing deals and how they affect the important, yet contentious, contractual provision of nonexclusivity. Drawing on transaction cost, experiential learning, and bargaining power theories, we develop new insights explaining when licensors are likely to realize nonexclusive contracts as a function of their prior licensing deals, and when bargaining power moderates the relationships between prior deals and nonexclusivity. Leveraging a 27-year sample of bioscience licensing transactions, this study reveals the dynamic tension between the benefits and transaction costs arising from prior interfirm collaborations, and how a firm's history of collaborations, alongside its bargaining power position, influences contractual outcomes.

This study examines the barriers and enablers within the adoption process of advanced manufacturing technologies (AMTs) and their relationship to different innovation types as outcomes of this process. Whilst the requirement to improve AMT adoption is widely acknowledged, the existing literature lacks a comprehensive understanding of the main barriers and enablers within the adoption process. Furthermore, it does not reveal how these barriers and enablers are related to different innovation types. We provide a systematic literature review of the barriers and enablers to AMT adoption. The findings of this review are based on a total of eighty-seven peer-reviewed articles from the business and management literature from 1999-2019. Our findings provide several contributions to the literature. Firstly, by integrating evidence from empirical studies, we identify five main types of barriers and four main types of enablers to adoption. Secondly, we conceptualise three key stages of the AMT adoption process and classify the barriers and enablers on the basis of whether they apply to an individual stage, or whether their influence is pertinent across the whole process. Thirdly, we reveal the relationship between categories of barriers and enablers associated to innovation types outcomes: product, process, service or business model innovations. The results of our study provide important implications for both managers and policy makers based on the evidence of the key barriers and enablers. Further, we suggest several directions for future research, including the need to examine the post-installation stage.

That is, the cultural impacts of corporations, or the bearing, at various levels of their business models, activities, and outcomes on the value systems and enduring beliefs of affected people. We introduce the notion of corporate cultural responsibility (CCR). The way corporations address CCR concerns can be reflected according to three stances: cultural destructiveness, cultural carelessness, and cultural prowess. Taken sequentially, they reflect a growing comprehension and increasingly active consideration of CCR concerns by corporations. In turn, we explicitly address issues related to the complex question of determining the cultural responsibilities of corporate actors; specify key CCR-related conceptualizations; and lay a foundation for discussions, debates, and research efforts centered on CCR concerns and rationales.

This paper analyzes the impact of this business model on players' gaming behavior, the game provider's strategies for virtual currency price and ad level, and social welfare. Our findings have important managerial implications for the gaming industry and policy makers. We find that when the enabling-power rate of virtual currency (i.e., how much players benefit from enhanced gameplay due to virtual currency generated per unit of playing time) is stronger, players have lower incentive to purchase virtual currency. Therefore, the provider should set a lower price to avoid losing too much demand. In the meantime, the marginal benefit of playing the game increases, and thus the provider should set a higher ad level to take advantage of this boosted marginal benefit for players when the base valuation of gameplay is sufficiently low. Finally, we demonstrate that offering in-game purchases of virtual currency as a new business model benefits society as a whole. Our findings suggest that regulators of the gaming industry should be less concerned about the risk of excessive gameplay for games that sell virtual currency compared with those that do not. Despite the growing popularity of in-game purchases of virtual currency in digital games, there is very limited formal research that studies this new business model. This paper builds on the neoclassical labor–leisure model to examine the impact of selling virtual currency on players' gameplay behavior, game provider's strategies, and social welfare. When the game provider offers virtual currency for sale, players have two options to obtain virtual currency— playing the game and purchasing virtual currency directly. We introduce a parameter—the enabling-power rate of virtual currency—to characterize the extent to which virtual currency generated in a unit of playing time can augment players' production of gaming leisure. We find that selling virtual currency reduces the playing time for certain heavy players, whereas it boosts certain light players' playing time. It may also lead to a larger player base allowing more people to enjoy the benefits of playing digital games when the enabling-power rate of virtual currency is sufficiently high. The game provider should charge a higher (lower) virtual currency price for a game with a relatively lower (higher) enabling-power rate of virtual currency. She should also set a higher (lower) ad level for a game with a relatively higher (lower) enabling-power rate if the game's base valuation of gameplay, that is, the valuation of gameplay independent of virtual currency, is sufficiently low. Finally, we demonstrate that selling virtual currency could lead to a win–win–win situation for the game provider, players, and society as a whole. It will alleviate the conflict of interest between the provider's goal of longer playing time to maximize her ad revenue from in-game ads and the social goal of reducing excessive gaming, especially for heavy players.

However, the mechanisms underlying knowledge spill-ins and their importance for external learning in uncertain technology environments have not been examined in detail. This article compares corporate venturing (CV) spinouts that are supported by parent firms with independent employee spinouts as well as other strategies for external learning, such as investments and alliances. An analysis of the patenting activities of leading corporations operating in the information and communication technology industry reveals that, ceteris paribus, when firms recombine unfamiliar knowledge components developed by their CV spinouts, their inventions are associated with higher quality than comparable firms' inventions that recombine knowledge from the firm's corporate venture capital portfolio ventures, allies, or employee spinouts. This effect is especially pronounced when CV spinout inventors hold parent-specific technological expertise. The results are robust across several econometric specifications that account for selection and intrinsic differences in external learning strategies. Furthermore, the results indicate that CV spinouts benefit their parent firms by reducing uncertainty relative to other strategic formats for external learning in unfamiliar technological areas. The detailed theoretical and practical implications derived from this research reflect perspectives on technology strategy and corporate renewal.

Received wisdom, in both management theory and practice, would suggest that a practice that lowers the life expectancy of adopting firms, over time, will vanish because it puts those firms at a competitive disadvantage. In this paper, I challenge this view. I develop a conceptual model that details how a practice that lowers the survival chances of adopting organizations may still spread and continue to exist across a population of firms. I propose that a combination of three basic conditions is sufficient to bring about this phenomenon: if the practice is somehow associated with success, if there exists causal ambiguity, and if the rate of its diffusion is high compared with the rate at which it accelerates firms’ demise, the practice may continue to thrive and become a widespread and persistent feature in an industry. A pivotal conceptual insight is that the endurance of particular management practices and strategies is not merely a corollary of the competitiveness of the organizations that use them but that they have fitness levels of their own. Managerial Summary: All organizations have “best practices”: habits that they have picked up in the past or mimicked from others. Managers often believe that these must be the best ways of doing things, because otherwise market forces would have eliminated them. The theory in the paper explains why this belief may be wrong. Some enduring practices may be harmful without managers realizing it because it is not necessarily the most optimal practices that survive (just like harmful viruses persist in nature). As a corollary, the paper discusses how the identification and cessation of detrimental practices can form a new source of and way to understand innovation.

We argue that the boundedly rational decision-maker is underspecified in international business models and this oversight contributes to weak empirical findings on experience, learning, internationalization strategy and MNE performance. Drawing on these extant models, we identify seven knowledge domains and interdependencies that may make up decision-makers' mental models. Granted rare access to senior executives and board members engaged in a foreign direct investment decision, we find substantial heterogeneity in the mental models these individuals used to make sense of the opportunity. This variance aligns with differences in individuals' experience along four dimensions: international breadth, depth, diversity and prior strategic decision-making. We argue these cognitive processes - how individuals exercise judgment about information search parameters, assessment and decision integration, and how decision teams coalesce in their thinking - are crucial microfoundations for modeling heterogeneity in firm-level internationalization strategies and performance.

In this paper, working closely with the American Red Cross (ARC), we study a blood collection problem focusing on whole blood that is to be processed into cryoprecipitate (cryo), a critical blood product for controlling massive hemorrhaging. In particular, we aim to determine when and from which mobile collection sites to collect blood for cryo production, such that the weekly collection target is met while the collection costs are minimized. The cryo collection problem imposes a unique challenge: if blood collected is to be processed into cryo units, it has to be processed within eight hours after collection, while this time limit is 24 hours for most other blood products. To analyze the cryo collection problem, we first develop a mathematical program to represent and compare two different blood collection business models, namely, the status quo nonsplit model and an alternative model we propose, which splits each collection window into two intervals and allows different types of collections in the two intervals. Then, we establish several structural properties of the proposed mathematical program and develop a near-optimal solution algorithm to determine the cryo collection schedules under each collection model. Our extensive computational analyses based on real data indicated that, compared with the status quo, our proposed collection model can significantly reduce total collection costs. Based on this significant potential impact, our proposed collection model has been implemented by the ARC Douglasville manufacturing facility, the largest ARC blood manufacturing facility supplying blood to about 120 hospitals in the southern United States. Field data from postimplementation indicated that our proposed solution has resulted in (i) reducing inconsistencies in supply of cryo collections, and (ii) an approximately 40% reduction in the per-unit collection cost for cryo. Because of this success, the ARC is now at the stage of rolling out our proposed solution approach to other regions in the nation.

We model a capacity-constrained firm, a random-sized population of strategic customers, a desirable hot period, and a less desirable slow period. Compared to a more traditional approach (slow period discounting or closure), threshold discounting has two operational advantages. First, the contingent discount temporally balances demand when the market for the service is large, and reduces supply of the service (preserving higher margins) when the market is small, allowing the firm to respond to the service's unobserved market potential. Second, activation of the threshold discount signals the market state and the consequent service availability to strategic customers, inducing them into self-selecting the consumption period to one that improves the firm's capacity utilization. Yet, threshold discounting can be harmful in situations with chronically low demand. In contrast with past work on strategic customers, their presence is advantageous to firms in our context. A calibrated numerical study shows that threshold discounting improves firm profits over a traditional approach by as much as 33% (7% on average).

"Sources of Variation in the Efficiency of Adopting Management Innovation: The Role of Absorptive Capacity Routines, Managerial Attention and Organizational Legitimacy.","Peeters, Carine; Massini, Silvia; Lewin, Arie Y.","Organization Studies",="01708406",,="Sep2014","35","9","1343","29","97956135","10.1177/0170840614539311","Sage Publications Inc.","Article","Absorptive capacity (Economics); Economic development; Business models; Organizational legitimacy; Industrial management","absorptive capacity routines; global sourcing of business services; management innovation; managerial attention; organizational legitimacy; process efficiency","Drawing on two in-depth case studies, this paper develops a conceptual model of how absorptive capacity routines and their underlying processes of evolution influence the efficiency of management innovation adaptation processes. The model highlights three important relations. First, although different configurations of absorptive capacity routines can lead to the successful implementation of the same management innovation – namely the reconfiguration of firms’ value chains through sourcing of business services from offshore countries – the sequence of developing routines, their adequacy, and the interdependencies fit between routines partly explain how rapidly and seamlessly a firm is able to implement a management innovation. Second, we identify managerial attention and organizational legitimacy as two critical and interrelated sources of variation of the efficiency in the process of adopting and adapting management innovations. Finally, attention direction by a top-level internal change agent is more effective than local problemistic search to foster managerial attention and organizational legitimacy to both the management innovation to be adopted, and the need to develop and put into practice an appropriate set of absorptive capacity routines.

"Predicting Customer Value Using Clumpiness: From RFM to RFMC.","Yao Zhang; Bradlow, Eric T.; Small, Dylan S.","Marketing Science",="07322399",,="Mar/Apr2015","34","2","195","14","109560632","10.1287/mksc.2014.0873","INFORMS: Institute for Operations Research","Article","Customer lifetime value; Customer services; Customer relations; Marketing strategy; Marketing research; Marketing Research and Public Opinion Polling","clumpiness; customer lifetime value; RFM","In recent years, customer lifetime value (CLV) has gained increasing importance in both academia and practice. Although many advanced techniques have been proposed, the recency/frequency/monetary value (RFM) segmentation framework, and its related probability models, remain a CLV mainstay. In this article, we demonstrate the deficiency in RFM as a basis for summarizing customer history (data compression), and extend the framework to include clumpiness (C) by a metric-based approach. Our main empirical finding is that C adds to the predictive power, above and beyond RFM and firm marketing action, of both the churn, incidence, and monetary value parts of CLV. Hence, we recommend a significant implementation change: from RFM to RFMC. This work is also motivated by noting that although statistical models based on RFM summaries can fit well in aggregate, their use can lead to significant micro-level (e.g., ranking of customers) prediction errors unless C is captured. A set of detailed empirical studies using data from a large North American retailer, in addition to six companies that vary in their business model: two traditional (e.g., CDNow.com) and four Internet (e.g., Hulu.com), demonstrate that the ""clumpiness phenomena"" is widely prevalent, and that companies with ""bingeable content"" have both high potential and high risk segments, previously unseen, but now uncovered because of the new framework: RFM to RFMC.

"Online Music Consumption in Today's Technological Context: Putting the Influence of Ethics in Perspective.","Weijters, Bert; Goedertier, Frank; Verstreken, Sofie","Journal of Business Ethics",="01674544",,="Nov2014","124","4","537","14","98773959","10.1007/s10551-013-1892-y","Springer Nature","Article","Consumer preferences research; Internet music piracy; Law; Electronic shopping and mail-order houses; Music downloading (Computers); Music & technology; Music surveys; Music -- Economic aspects","Age; Conjoint analysis; Digital music; Marketing; Music piracy; Online","Whereas in the past 'free' and 'illegal' were nearly synonymous in the music industry, consumers nowadays face a myriad of music platforms with widely different characteristics in terms of business model (advertising supported, fee based, etc.), delivery mode (streaming, downloading, etc.), and others. The current research examines music consumption preferences in this new context. In order to break with the outmoded free-illegal versus paid-legal dichotomy, the present research studies consumer preferences for a broader range of music platform attributes, including free versus paying business models, (il)legality of use, artist revenues, downloading versus streaming, and audio quality. Based on a literature review and a qualitative study with in-depth interviews ( N = 92), an online conjoint survey ( N = 764) quantifies online music preferences. Results show that consumers of all ages clearly and consistently prefer legal and ethical options if available, but favor different ways of making this economically viable. Youngsters and young adults are more open to advertising, while middle-aged adults are more often willing to pay for advertising-free platforms. Thus, in real-life choices, youngsters may appear to be less ethical and law abiding, but the driving force behind this is mainly economical. Finally, a market segmentation provides deeper insights into online music consumer preferences and leads to recommendations on how to define viable legal and ethical music offerings.

Analyzing a case study in the European real estate industry, we show how actors strategically manage inter-organizational relations and take advantage of rising asset prices, through refinancing on the basis of loan-to-value even before the originate-to-distribute-cycle of the mortgage industry unfolds. Valuation and accounting are core practices of financialized business models that evolve around management fees, which serve as value carriers and bring potential future profits into the present. Auditing also plays a role as it legitimizes these business activities and facilitates jurisdictional arbitrage. We contribute to the accounting literature by explaining how the strategic configuration of a valuation-accounting nexus leads to organizational short-termism and rewards unsustainable business activities in the real estate industry.

We suggest that a multinational corporation (MNC) entering these markets must resolve the institutional voids in product, labor, and capital markets, as well as address issues of regulatory ambiguities and the lack of contracting mechanisms that exist at the raw material, manufacturing, distribution, and marketing stages of the supply chain. We analyze the nature of these voids and their challenges, map them onto the value chain, discuss their interconnections, and suggest that they do not impact all firms equally. We provide examples from the food, beverage, and textile industries of how four firms have addressed institutional voids in constructing their supply chains. We conclude by providing implications, both across the value chain and regarding the trade-offs of partnering with non-profit agencies. Our analysis highlights the importance of going beyond the broad impact of the institutional environment to understanding its more nuanced and multi-faceted effect on supply chains.
